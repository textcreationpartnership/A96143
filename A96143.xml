            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And where is that <hi>ſpirit</hi> of <hi>love</hi> amongſt you, that is <hi>kinde</hi> to the <hi>evil</hi> and <hi>unthankful?</hi> and why do you <hi>ſeek</hi> to civil Governours <hi>to aſſiſt</hi> in upholding <hi>that</hi> you call your <hi>Religion,</hi> and in <hi>puniſhing</hi> all thoſe that are contrary to it, ſeeing Chriſt and his Apoſtles did not ſo? doth it not hence plainly <hi>appear,</hi> that you own the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in <hi>words,</hi> but denies it <hi>in your practice?</hi> Oh my <hi>dear</hi> Hearts! Are <hi>you</hi> talking of the Word being a <hi>rule,</hi> of being <hi>frequent</hi> in duties, of becomming <hi>obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent</hi> to Gods <hi>revealed</hi> will, and walk not according to that <hi>rule,</hi> but in words and outward <hi>reſtraint</hi> of ſome common vices? have any of you at any time given freely
<pb facs="tcp:118719:10"/>of your goods to the poor, or relieved poor Captives impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned for debt, or viſited the poor Widows and Father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe children in their neceſſities, purely for Chriſts ſake? nay this is not with you; and if it were, what were it available if it ſhould not be from a right Principle; yet I know you can ſpeak well, but alas that helps not.</p>
            <p>Well, thus I have clearly <hi>declared</hi> your eſtate; it therefore now remains <hi>to ſhew</hi> unto you, why you do all theſe things; even becauſe you have not <hi>known</hi> Chriſt nor the father working <hi>in you</hi> death to all theſe <hi>deviliſh</hi> deceits, that your ſoules might come to <hi>live</hi> in him who is <hi>Truth</hi> it ſelfe, And then you would not onely be <hi>profeſſors,</hi> but <hi>poſſeſſors</hi> of that <hi>Eternal</hi> love which would <hi>lead you into the truth</hi> and goodneſſe in <hi>ſincerity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But becauſe this <hi>friend</hi> of truth <hi>will</hi> not, nor <hi>cannot</hi> own, your outſide worſhip, he having by Gods power <hi>found</hi> the deceit thereof, he is therefore <hi>by you</hi> caſt out as a <hi>Heretick,</hi> and ſo are all thoſe that in <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>uprightneſſe</hi> of heart, are <hi>led</hi> and <hi>acted</hi> forth by God, to work his <hi>own</hi> works; for <hi>Wiſdom is juſtified of her Children.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond thing that is breathed forth in this book, is this, that as Chriſt is <hi>the Foundation,</hi> ſo he alone it is that doth <hi>build upon</hi> this Foundation, that <hi>building</hi> that will <hi>ſtand</hi> when all other <hi>ſhall</hi> and <hi>muſt</hi> fall; and not only ſo, but he likewiſe <hi>begins</hi> the work of his own <hi>power</hi> in every particular ſoule and <hi>carries on</hi> the ſame with his <hi>own</hi> hand, in deſpight of all <hi>oppoſition;</hi> cauſing <hi>fleſh</hi> and all the <hi>power</hi> thereof, to <hi>fall down</hi> before his face, into <hi>death, miſery, judgment,</hi> and <hi>condemnation,</hi> where all the glory of the <hi>firſt</hi> creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is <hi>ſeald down</hi> under the covenant of <hi>death,</hi> never
<pb facs="tcp:118719:10"/>to riſe again in its own <hi>ſtrength, power, wiſdom,</hi> nor <hi>righteouſneſſe;</hi> but if ever <hi>it riſe again,</hi> it may <hi>riſe</hi> in the <hi>power, wiſdom,</hi> and <hi>righteouſneſſe of Jeſus, the Eternal Son of the living God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus God exerciſes his people under the <hi>admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration</hi> of his <hi>power,</hi> by bringing <hi>life</hi> out of <hi>death, mercy</hi> out of <hi>miſery, fulneſſe</hi> out of <hi>emptineſſe, ſtrength</hi> out of <hi>weakneſſe, ſufficiency</hi> out of <hi>inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency, joy</hi> out of <hi>ſorrow, peace</hi> out of <hi>war,</hi> and doth not <hi>break the bruiſed reed, nor quench the ſmoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king flax,</hi> until <hi>he hath brought forth judgment in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to victory;</hi> and as he <hi>begineth</hi> and <hi>carrieth on</hi> his own <hi>work</hi> ſo alſo he it is and none but he that <hi>perfects</hi> it, as ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>he that hath begun a good work will perfect it;</hi> For it was the <hi>Eternal love of</hi> the Lord which <hi>by his Son</hi> planted the <hi>righteous ſeed</hi> in every ſoule of his, and it is the ſame <hi>power</hi> and <hi>love</hi> that cauſeth it to <hi>grow</hi> in the ſpirit of man above all <hi>carnal</hi> power, ſtrength, or policy; for the <hi>pure ſeed</hi> ſhal reign till <hi>all its enemies be ſubdued,</hi> and the ſpirits of thoſe <hi>in whom it is,</hi> perfectly redeemed from the <hi>Shrines</hi> and <hi>Vizzards</hi> of mortality.</p>
            <p>Oh how it doth chear my heart! to ſee our <hi>near</hi> and <hi>dear</hi> IMMAN<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>EL ſpringing forth unto the <hi>blind</hi> world in and through <hi>earthen veſſels,</hi> to the <hi>praiſe</hi> of the <hi>glory</hi> of Gods <hi>great</hi> grace, who hath made us accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in his beloved Therefore <hi>Reader,</hi> if thou findeſt any of theſe <hi>workings</hi> in thy own <hi>ſoul,</hi> then mayſt thou <hi>know</hi> that they are no <hi>fictions,</hi> but the real <hi>operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of Gods great <hi>power;</hi> but if thou look not on them <hi>in the light of truth,</hi> there will be <hi>no unity</hi> between <hi>thee</hi> and the <hi>party</hi> through whom they were <hi>uttered;</hi> for he lives <hi>in the life</hi> of that which here is <hi>declared</hi> by
<pb facs="tcp:118719:11"/>words, and if thou live in <hi>the ſame life,</hi> and look upon them <hi>in the ſame light,</hi> then will they be <hi>matter of rejoycing</hi> to thy ſoul; but if thou look upon them <hi>any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way,</hi> they will be nothing <hi>to thee</hi> but <hi>Parables</hi> and <hi>Riddles.</hi> Thus hoping and <hi>knowing</hi> that God will make this <hi>work</hi> and every other, <hi>work together for good to them that love him,</hi> I commend thee to God and to <hi>the work of his grace;</hi> Reſting thy Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Companion in tribulation, in the Kingdom and Patience of Jeſus Chriſt,</p>

               <hi>for thou haſt done wonderful things, thy Counſels of old are faithfulneſs and truth;</hi> In which, he gives thanks, as in the perſon of Jeſus Chriſt, or as a member of him, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth the deep and wonderful things which have been wrought onely and alone by Him. From whence we may take notice, that the ſongs and praiſes of all Saints, are only and alone to magnifie and lift up Jeſus Chriſt:<note place="margin">Pſal. 29.9.</note> 
               <hi>In his Temple every one ſpeaks of his glory:</hi> they have nothing to ſay in praiſe of man, of the power of man, wiſdom of man, or the glory of man, of the faithfulneſs of man, of the counſels of man, but of the Lord alone.</p>
            <p>They are not telling forth what <hi>they</hi> have done, <hi>to bring glory to themſelves;</hi> or to ſet up their <hi>wiſdome,</hi> or <hi>power,</hi> or <hi>parts,</hi> or any thing in them; of their <hi>righteouſneſſe,</hi> of their <hi>holineſs,</hi> of their <hi>love,</hi> of their <hi>joy,</hi> of their <hi>peace,</hi> or any thing of this nature;<note place="margin">Luk, 18.11.</note> as the Scribes and Phariſees, <hi>I am not ſo and ſo,</hi> and I do thus and thus, thereby <hi>to magnifie</hi> themſelves, or to make others think highly of them; no, but their <hi>ſongs</hi> and their <hi>praiſe</hi> is alone to exalt Jeſus Chriſt, and to tell of his doings, of his counſels, of his faithfulneſs and truth, of his <hi>mercies</hi> and <hi>loving kindneſse,</hi> of his <hi>righteouſneſse</hi> and <hi>judgements;</hi> this is <hi>their</hi> glory, and this is <hi>their</hi> ſong.</p>
            <p>In the Second verſe, you may ſee how he <hi>ſets out</hi> the ſpoiles and the ruins that Jeſus Chriſt hath made; <hi>Great and glorious Cities made heaps; of a defenſed City a ruine:</hi> That ſtrong city <hi>Babel</hi> built up by the power and wiſdom of man,<note place="margin">Gen. 11.</note> for his <hi>protection</hi> and <hi>defence,</hi> which he would raiſe up to Heaven, to prevent deſtruction <hi>hereafter,</hi> that the deluge <hi>of wrath</hi> may not ſwallow him up; The ſoule having ſeen the Almighty power of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>ruining,</hi> and <hi>bringing down</hi> this <hi>Tower,</hi> and this BABEL in himſelf, and making <hi>all this work</hi> power, wiſdom, providence of man, of <hi>ſelf</hi> and <hi>fleſh</hi> to be made <hi>Bable, Confuſion;</hi> here now, the <hi>Saints</hi> give all the glory to Jeſus Chriſt <hi>alone;</hi> Man finds that he was raiſing a <hi>Temple,</hi> ſetting up a <hi>Worſhip</hi> of his <hi>own</hi> deviſing; for what end? that he may ſecure <hi>himſelf,</hi> provide for <hi>himſelf,</hi> deliver <hi>himſelfe</hi> from <hi>wrath,</hi> from <hi>hell,</hi> from the <hi>overflowing ſcourge,</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:118719:14"/>from the <hi>devouring flood;</hi> he thought <hi>himſelfe</hi> to be wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in working and glorying in his own devices,<note place="margin">Eſa. 28.15</note> in his own <hi>religion,</hi> in his own <hi>forms,</hi> and thereby thought <hi>this Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> would ſecure him, no <hi>deluge</hi> could reach him, he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all danger; as <hi>Paul,</hi> he was marching on confidently and boldly <hi>in his own</hi> uprightneſſe, and thought he acted all things <hi>according to the rule;</hi>

               <hi>and of a defenced City a ruinous place of ſtrangers:</hi> and this to be no City and ſhall never be built againe: when once Jeſus Chriſt pulls down Babel <hi>in us,</hi> it ſhall never be built againe: He hath laid it all <hi>flat</hi> to the ground.

The work of the Devil is to build up <hi>man</hi> in his own wiſdom, in his own ſtrength, to make him ſomething; to cry <hi>peace peace</hi> to him, <hi>when there is no peace;</hi>

            <p>Firſt, becauſe Jeſus Chriſt is not known and underſtood in the <hi>pretiouſneſs, excellency</hi> and <hi>value</hi> of him to the <hi>loſt, blind,</hi>

               <note place="margin">Pſal. 14.2.</note> 
               <hi>but they are all gone out of the way; there is none thath doth good, no not one:</hi> ſo I ſay, man comes not to Jeſus Chriſt, becauſe he is ignorant of that <hi>life, glory, righteouſneſs,</hi> and <hi>immortality</hi> that is <hi>laid up</hi> in him; therefore the Apoſtle renders it as the <hi>reaſon</hi> why the Princes of the world (Princes of <hi>learning,</hi> and Princes in <hi>zeal</hi> and <hi>religion</hi>) kild him; why, becau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe (ſaith he) none of the Princes of this world <hi>knew him; for had they known him, they would not have crucified the Lord of

            </p>
            <p>Again, men cannot come to Jeſus Chriſt, becauſe as he is the <hi>power</hi> of God, and appears in the <hi>wiſdom</hi> of God, ſo he appears as <hi>foliſhneſs</hi> unto them, and they diſdaine him as a <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>mean</hi> thing; as <hi>Iſaiah</hi> faith in ch. 53. v. 2. <hi>there is no form nor beauty in him why he ſhould be deſired:</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Again, another ground why the ſouls of men come not to Chriſt, <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>3</label> is, becauſe the appearing of Chriſt in <hi>the ſpirit</hi> makes all the <hi>hidden</hi> things of <hi>mans heart</hi> lie open, even that which man himſelfe never <hi>ſaw,</hi> nor never <hi>thought</hi> was in him, and <hi>this</hi> man hates, and will not abide to ſee nor behold that <hi>depth</hi> of pride, that ſelfe-glorying, <hi>hypocriſie,</hi> &amp;c. and taht bottomleſſe <hi>pit</hi> of miſery; mans eye never looked into himſelf, into his own heart: but in the day of the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:118719:39"/>of Jeſus Chriſt all this is diſcovered and laid open; therefore man would by <hi>no means</hi> come to Chriſt, becauſe the appearing of Chriſt <hi>diſcovers his ſin</hi> and <hi>condemnation:</hi> man loves his own life: <hi>skin for skin, and all that a man hath will be give for his life; but he that loſeth his life ſhall find it:</hi>

               <note place="margin">Joh. 1.9. Mat. 6.23.</note> 
               <hi>And if this light that is in us be darkneſs, how great is that dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> Here is the condemnation of all the ſons of men that they dare not ſtand in the light of Chriſt, not being able to behold hell in their own hearts, but labour by all means to cover it; for the light of Chriſt would ſhew them that there is no thought, action, or duty, or performance that ever they did, that had any thing of <hi>purity</hi> in it, but it was <hi>all</hi> ſin; Now man not daring to ſee <hi>his own miſery,</hi> therefore he runs from this light, and gets himſelfe behinde any <hi>tree.</hi> He runs from <hi>the appearance of him that ſits upon the Throne,</hi> and ſo reſolves he will not ſee his own miſery, <hi>death,</hi> and <hi>condemnation;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. 6.16</note> neither will he believe it though he be told it by an <hi>Angel from Heaven,</hi> he will not <hi>come to the light,</hi> leſt thereby he may <hi>know,</hi> or be <hi>convinced</hi> that his deeds are <hi>onely</hi> evil.</p>
            <p>Againe <hi>this is</hi> the work of the Father to draw men unto Chriſt, becauſe no leſſe then <hi>infinitneſs</hi> and <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> is able to bring <hi>God and man</hi> together; the ſeparation between God and man is ſo <hi>vaſt,</hi> and they are at ſuch an infinite diſtance ſince his fall, that nothing but <hi>Infinitneſs</hi> can bring theſe two <hi>infinite</hi> ends together; for the ſoul of man in one ſin, ſins againſt an <hi>infinite God;</hi> in any one ſin it goes out and turns away from the infinitneſſe of all bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſſe, good, joy, glory, and peace, and ſo goes down

               <note place="margin">Luk. 15. 13.</note> as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal was; now therefore nothing but the <hi>infinite</hi> powers, and <hi>infinite</hi> wiſedome and ſtrength that is in the Lord, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to bring <hi>life</hi> out of <hi>death, ſomething</hi> out of <hi>nothing;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is nothing to bring the heart of man out of <hi>that far country</hi> wherein to it is gone, and out of that <hi>bottomleſs pit</hi> into which is is fallen; nothing can do it but <hi>infinitneſs</hi> and <hi>eternity;</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 4.14.</note> nothing but <hi>the ſame ſpirit that raiſed up Jeſus Chriſt from the dead, can quicken our mortal bodies:</hi> there is nothing I ſay, able to do it (but the ſame ſpirit) to bring a <hi>poor ſoul</hi> from hell and condemnation, and make it one in unity with the ſpirit; And therefore the Apoſtle witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Eph. 2.13. <hi>you that were aliens, hath he made nigh by the blood of Chriſt;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. 2.13</note> 
               <hi>and you that were ſometimes afar off, hath he made near by the blood of Chriſt.</hi> So now, I hope this appears a truth <hi>to you,</hi> and I hope the Lord will make it ſo <hi>in you</hi> by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; till then it is not a <hi>ſavour of life unto life;</hi> for except you have the Scriptures made good in the power thereof, in your <hi>own</hi> hearts, what are the Scriptures to you?

            <p>God is ſaid to be <hi>a Spirit, and they that worſhip him, muſt worſhip him in ſpirit and in truth:</hi>

            <p>And know farther, It is the <hi>Spirit of the Father,</hi> the ſame <hi>Eternal power</hi> of the Father, even the ſame that is <hi>God:</hi> for it is the ſame God, though the <hi>manifeſtations</hi> be <hi>diverſe,</hi> and though there be the <hi>manifeſtations</hi> of the <hi>Father,</hi> and <hi>Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> yet they are <hi>One:</hi> for they are not <hi>Three,</hi> but <hi>One.</hi>

            <p>The next thing I ſhall explain, is, what is meant by Chriſt; no man come UNTO MEE: <hi>By Mee,</hi> here is not meant the coming to the <hi>fleſhly preſence</hi> and body of Chriſt: then muſt we (with <hi>Mary</hi>) ſeek him among the <hi>dead;</hi> no, <hi>he is riſen, he is not here;</hi> it is not meant of the coming to Chriſt in the <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> and <hi>Notion,</hi> and in the <hi>Letter:</hi> ſo all men <hi>making profeſſion</hi> are come to Chriſt:<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.19.

               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.24.</note> Chriſt the <hi>power of God and wiſdom of God.</hi> So that to come <hi>unto</hi> Chriſt, is to come <hi>to the power of Chriſt in us,</hi> to
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:118719:42"/>have him <hi>abiding</hi> and <hi>dwelling</hi> in us, carrying us, and lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us <hi>into all truth:</hi> and therefore he tells you againe,<note place="margin">Joh. 16.13.

               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 13:5.</note> and the <hi>wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> of God; Nay, it is God <hi>in us,</hi> teaching us, and guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us, and directing us; he being the ſole <hi>Maſter, Ruler, power,</hi> and <hi>ſtrength</hi> in us; this is <hi>to come</hi> to Jeſus Chriſt: From whence it being thus explained, there is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction or two we would draw from what hath beene ſaid.</p>
            <p>Firſt, if the <hi>immortal</hi> Spirit onely draw the ſoules of men unto <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that is, unto <hi>himſelf;</hi>

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:118719:43"/>where is the man that <hi>minds</hi> him? but onely ſeeks <hi>himſelfe,</hi> his own <hi>reſt,</hi> and to quiet his own heart, and to cover the <hi>ſmoak,</hi> and the <hi>cry,</hi> and the <hi>guilt</hi> that lies upon him, and to get <hi>comfort to himſelf,</hi> and then he is ſafe, and he thinks he is gotten neer to Jeſus Chriſt. And when he wants <hi>peace,</hi> then he bethinks himſelf of walking more cloſe, and ſtricter to thoſe <hi>forms</hi> and <hi>rules</hi> that quieted his <hi>conſcience</hi> before; and thus he runs in a round, and makes <hi>himſelf,</hi> his <hi>works,</hi> and <hi>duties</hi> his Saviour. For if thou askeſt thy own heart ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly what is the reaſon of thy <hi>praying</hi> and going into this <hi>form,</hi> or the other <hi>form,</hi> is it not becauſe thou thinkeſt God therefore <hi>accepts</hi> thee, and <hi>loves</hi> thee? And is not this to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny this truth, <hi>that there is nothing but the power of the Father can draw thee,</hi> that there is nothing able to draw thee, but the <hi>immortal ſeed</hi> and Almighty <hi>hand of</hi> God; and to ſay, that ſomething elſe is ſufficient to draw thee unto Chriſt? But here now lies <hi>the depth</hi> of this <hi>deceit;</hi> thou draweſt in a Religious way, and haſt gotten a covering, and a profeſſion, and ſuch and ſuch actions into thy hands; and here thou reſteſt, and what follows? thou <hi>gathereſt together,</hi> and heap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt up all Nations to make thy ſelf <hi>ſtrong</hi> and <hi>ſecure;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hab. 2.5.</note> but thou covereſt not with the <hi>covering of the Lord;</hi> and ſo thereby layeſt <hi>ſin upon ſin,</hi> thou covereſt indeed with a <hi>covering,</hi> that thereby the Condemnation,<note place="margin">Eſa. 30.1.</note> Hell, and Guilt in thy own heart may not be made manifeſt in thee.</p>
            <p>Now conſider whether ever thou canſt come at Jeſus Chriſt, who is the <hi>Rock of Ages,</hi> that goeſt not in <hi>the leadings of the Father.</hi> But if thy heart did apprehend that thou wert that <hi>child</hi> (which <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſpeaks of) <hi>caſt out into the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen field,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ezek. 16.</note> and hadſt <hi>no hand</hi> to help thee, nor <hi>no eye to pitty thee;</hi> if it were ſo with thee, then he would appear in thee, and lead thee: if thou thoughtſt thou waſt the <hi>ignoranteſt</hi> creature in the world: if thou waſt but <hi>blind</hi> enough, and <hi>bad</hi> enough in thy own ſight; but the miſery of the world lies herein,<note place="margin">Joh. 9.41</note> becauſe they think <hi>they ſee,</hi> therefore <hi>their ſin remains;</hi> for there is no difference among all the ſons of men, for <hi>All have ſinned and fallen ſhort of the glory of God:</hi> Thou mayeſt,<note place="margin">Rom. 3.21</note> and I know doeſt <hi>think</hi> ſo, that there is a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:118719:43"/>in ſome; but truth hath witneſſed it that <hi>every man</hi> hath ſinned, and is at an <hi>infinite diſtance from the Lord</hi> God of mercy; and there is no <hi>ſalvation,</hi> nor no power, but in the hand of the Allmighty, and that he alone is able to make <hi>peace</hi> and bring together thoſe two <hi>Infinite</hi> diſtances, and to make them <hi>One.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now judge whether this, or the way of the world brings the greateſt inconveniency, and whether <hi>this way of man</hi> do not ſet him at a farther diſtance from his <hi>true reſt;</hi> for if man think he can come to Chriſt by any thing of himſelfe, by any <hi>Religious</hi> actions, and <hi>performances:</hi> then from this it muſt needs follow, that he ſees not his own <hi>weakneſs</hi> nor <hi>wickedneſſe;</hi> nor there is no ſin, nor wickedneſſe, nor miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>made manifeſt unto him:</hi> And he <hi>makes lyes his refuge,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eſa. 22.15</note> 
               <hi>and under falſhood he hath hid himſelfe,</hi> and drawn way his heart from the <hi>living</hi> and <hi>eternal</hi> God, to depend upon the <hi>lying and deceitful</hi> power and wiſedome of <hi>man,</hi> and <hi>digged to himſelfe broken Ciſterns.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jer. 2.13.</note> So that</p>
            <p>Secondly, this will follow, that this man <hi>hath made a Rock</hi> to ſtay himſelfe upon; for if thou thinkeſt that thy <hi>actions</hi> and <hi>performances</hi> will bring thee <hi>neerer</hi> unto God then <hi>other</hi> men, or that any thing can draw thee <hi>neerer,</hi> but the meer hand and ſpirit of the Father: is not this (I ſay) <hi>to ſet up ſomething</hi> againſt the power of the Father? Is not this to ſet up <hi>errour</hi> againſt truth, and <hi>darkneſs</hi> againſt light, and <hi>Antichriſt</hi> againſt Chriſt? for here it is manifeſt that <hi>there is nothing</hi> but the power of the Father to <hi>draw men</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt. Now ſeeing thou haſt made <hi>Lyes</hi> thy delight, and <hi>vanity</hi> thy truſt, ſee what is pronounced againſt thee, <hi>for all thy confidence</hi> and <hi>ſtrong opinions</hi> of thy ſafety and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity: <hi>Curſed is the man that truſteth in man, and maketh fleſh his Arm, and whoſe Heart departeth from the Lord.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Then if it be the <hi>Fathers power and ſpirit, that</hi> onely <hi>draws men</hi> unto Chriſt: <label type="milestone">

               <hi>he having obtained a far more excellent miniſtry, by how much he is made the mediatour of a better covenant, and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed upon better promiſes: he is not a high Prieſt of a Temple, or contained in any Temple made with hands:</hi>

            <p>But what ſhall we ſay then of all thoſe things wherein <hi>Moſes</hi> was commanded to be ſo exact, <hi>and to make all things
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:118719:51"/>according to the pattern?</hi> and here he calls Chriſt <hi>the true Tabernacle;</hi> what was theirs a falſe one?

Now all things muſt be according to him; for he is the true <hi>pattern,</hi> and is that one and alone Sacrifice, <hi>once ffered;</hi> as in that ninth chapter of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 9.11. &amp;c.</note> and the eleventh verſe and ſo on, <hi>Chriſt being an high Prieſt of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect Tabernacle, not made with hands; that is to ſay, not of this building; and by his own blood he entered into the Holy Place; and if the blood of Bulls and Goats ſanctifyeth to the purifying of the ſteſh, how much more ſhall the blood of Chriſt, who through the eternal ſpirit offered up himſelfe without ſpot to God, purge your conſciences from dead works?</hi> &amp;c. Though all theſe things were done by Moſes, and all done according to the example and pattern; yet, ſaith he, the things <hi>we ſpeak of</hi> are not things <hi>done hy man,</hi> not of this <hi>building,</hi> that is, not done by the <hi>wiſdom, power,</hi> or will of <hi>man;</hi> no, nor thoſe done <hi>by them</hi> according to the direction of God himſelfe, (and in that ſenſe commanded and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable Ordinances) yet theſe <hi>made not the commers thereunto perfect;</hi> therefore, ſaith he, in the three and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth verſe of that ninth chapter, <hi>It was therefore neceſſary that the</hi> PATTERNS <hi>of the things in the Heavens ſhould be purified with theſe;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verſ. 23.</note> but <hi>the Heavenly things themſelves with better ſacrifices:</hi> for <hi>Chriſt is not entered into the Holy Places made with hands, which are the figures of the true, but into Heaven it ſelf, now to appear in the preſence of God for us:</hi> The
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:118719:52"/>Heavenly things themſelves purified, what's that? That is, <hi>the ſoules of men,</hi> which are of <hi>Heavenly</hi> natures and <hi>Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal;</hi> and if thoſe External Sacrifices muſt be <hi>purified with blood,</hi> it is much more neceſſary that that Heavenly and Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal <hi>ſoul of man</hi> ſhould be purified with the <hi>pretious blood of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.</hi> Man having departed from God, and defiled his ſoul by turning away from him, and being <hi>gone down</hi> to earthly things, to find himſelf a God, and a Truſt, and a Refuge: this departure is of that <hi>infinitneſs,</hi> that nothing but this <hi>Eternal Prieſt</hi> and <hi>Mediatour</hi> could reconcile and bring together again the <hi>Majeſty</hi> and Nature of God, and polluted man thus at an infinite diſtance; but <hi>He</hi> by <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf</hi> and of his <hi>own mercy and good will</hi> hath reconciled us to his father,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.20.

            <p>And by the way, let me mind you of one thing: That when the Scripture ſpeaks of Chriſt his <hi>Aſcending</hi> and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into the <hi>third Heaven, and far above all Heavens,</hi> and ſitting down <hi>on the right hand of his Father:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. 4.10. Heb: 12.2</note> 
               <hi>I</hi> would not have you ſo childiſh as to be deluded by thoſe <hi>tricks and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices</hi> of the men of the <hi>Letter,</hi> who not being able to ſee the myſtery, do take thoſe things as ſpoken <hi>litterally,</hi> as though Chriſt now had a <hi>material body,</hi> fleſh and bones, the ſame which he had in the fleſh, when he was upon earth; theſe are <hi>very fond</hi> inventions of men, that Chriſt is in a <hi>local</hi> place and ſits upon a <hi>Throne</hi> above in Heaven, next his Father as upon <hi>his right hand</hi> or the like: and when he comes to judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he will ſet himſelf in the material <hi>Clouds,</hi> and call all Nations before him, juſt as Judges doe at the <hi>Sizes;</hi> and there to ſit <hi>in a Chaire of State</hi> above all, or as <hi>Solomon upon</hi> a glorious Throne. Truly the world hath been a long time <hi>deluded</hi> with theſe fancies. Now as the Apoſtle ſaith, plainly, <hi>he is not entred into a place made with hands,</hi> nor into any thing of this nature,<note place="margin">Heb. 9.24</note> nor <hi>of this building:</hi> But we are when we ſpeak of him, to <hi>ſeparate</hi> all our thoughts <hi>far from</hi> all carnal things, and all <hi>creaturely</hi> beings. For there is no <hi>tincture</hi> of the creature concernments in thoſe heavenly and

            <p>But from all this which hath been ſpoken, hence it is clear, That the Tabernacle <hi>here ſpoken of,</hi> is, the <hi>glory, wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, power, righteouſneſſe</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt, and whatever is HIMSELF, who is nothing elſe but <hi>majeſty, purity, glory, wiſdom, love, goodneſſe, fulneſse, infinitneſſe, bleſſedneſſe,</hi> and <hi>Alſufficiency,</hi> and all <hi>good;</hi> he alone is <hi>the Lord,</hi>

And that Jeſus Chriſt is that <hi>ſpiritual Moſes,</hi> that ſpiritual <hi>high Prieſt,</hi> who hath <hi>once entred</hi> into this <hi>holy</hi> place, even <hi>once for all;</hi> And that the <hi>light</hi> in this <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> which is as a fire by Night, is that <hi>light</hi> and <hi>fire</hi> only that guildes and directs the ſouls of Saints in all their journeying through the <hi>deſolate</hi> Wilderneſſe of their own <hi>dark</hi> and <hi>blind</hi> hearts, and that <hi>this Tabernacle</hi> is covered with a <hi>cloud,</hi> that the eyes of men, nay, nor of Saints cannot <hi>ſee</hi> or <hi>behold</hi> it, till God <hi>himſelfe</hi> withdraws and removes it.

            </p>
            <p>Firſt, we have ſhewed that <hi>the divine fire</hi> of this <hi>Tabernacle</hi> is that onely which guides and directs the ſouls of men in their way towards the <hi>ſpirituall</hi> and <hi>heavenly Canaan;</hi> we have ſhewed thereupon the happineſs of the ſoul that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows and keeps with <hi>this Tabernacle,</hi> that alwaies ſees and beholds <hi>this fire of the Altar,</hi> that knows <hi>the fire that commeth down from Heaven,</hi> that burns up <hi>all things</hi> but it ſelf, but that remains and abides for ever. And this is the ſoul that in not a ſtranger unto the Lord, and the Lord is his Guide: Oh! happy is the ſoul that <hi>knows</hi> this, <hi>waits</hi> upon it, is onely <hi>led, councelled,</hi> and <hi>conducted</hi> by it: We have likewiſe ſpoken

            </p>
            <p>The next thing we ſhall obſerve, is concerning the Cloud that is <hi>over</hi> or <hi>upon</hi> the Tabernacle: wherein in the <hi>firſt</hi> place, this is apparent, that the Tabernacle, <hi>that contains</hi> all the Myſteries of life and mercy, all the glory of life and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Salvation: But this Tabernacle hath a <hi>cloud</hi> upon it, that it cannot be ſeen till the Cloud be taken away and removed, which all the power <hi>of man</hi> can never remove.</p>
            <p>And ſecondly, that the <hi>remover</hi> and <hi>taker</hi> away of this cloud, is God, and not man; that God, I ſay, is he alone that <hi>draws</hi> and <hi>takes</hi> up the cloud from the <hi>Tabernacle;</hi> and again lets it deſcend upon the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> when it pleaſeth him: Tis the Lord that draws away the vaile, and man with all his wiſdom, learning, induſtry, &amp;c. cannot pull it off of himſelf; tis the Lord alone that opens the eys of the blind, and not the holieſt man can doe any thing in this work of himſelf: Tis the Lord that circumciſeth the heart,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.13.</note> tis the Lord who baptiſeth the ſpirits of men with the true baptiſm; and all <hi>by one ſpirit, into one body,</hi> whether they be Jews or Gentiles; and I have ſhewed that one man cannot baptize another, as they undertake to doe in an Ape-like imitation of the thing; for it is the Lords work on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he alone can remove the cloud from off the Tabernacle, and gives the true Baptiſm: otherwiſe it abides and muſt remain thereupon, and the <hi>ſoule</hi> is not waſhed, nor baptized.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, take notice, that no man naturally walks by a true guide: and he that (when the cloud is upon the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle) offers to journey or move towards the <hi>heavenly Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> I ſay, when he offers or attempts any things in the way of God and Chriſt, he acts but <hi>blindly</hi> and <hi>preſumptuouſly,</hi>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:118719:63"/>and he cannot chuſe but ſtumble and fall; for, when the cloud is not taken off the Tabernacle by the hand of the Lord, then he ought <hi>to ſit in his tent,</hi> and abide <hi>in his habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi> till the Lord remove the cloud: and then is the time of his travel, and day of his journey, and not before.</p>
            <p>Firſt then it is <hi>clear,</hi> that by <hi>the Tabernacle,</hi> is meant the <hi>Myſteries</hi> of the Tabernacle: for, whether it be <hi>the pot of Manna,</hi> the <hi>Cenſers,</hi> or Rod of <hi>Aaron,</hi> and the reſt; All theſe be the myſteries of Chriſt; and all theſe have a <hi>cloud</hi> upon them, ſo that none can <hi>ſee</hi> them, or <hi>diſcern</hi> them, or <hi>behold the glory</hi> that is in them, till the cloud be <hi>taken away</hi> and <hi>removed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the beginning God made the heavens and earth:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 1.1, 2.</note> 
               <hi>and the earth was without form, and void, and darkneſſe was upon the face of the Deep,</hi> till God commanded the <hi>darkneſſe</hi> to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw, and ſay, <hi>Let there be light:</hi> ſo, till God make a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration between <hi>light</hi> and <hi>darkneſſe,</hi> otherwiſe there is a <hi>darkneſſe</hi> on the <hi>whole</hi> depth; the <hi>depth</hi> of HUMANITY or <hi>Creaturely</hi> nature; there was and is a darkneſſe on it all, till the Lord ſaid, <hi>Let there be Light,</hi> and there is light; there is a darkneſſe on <hi>all fleſh</hi> till the ſpirit of the Lord blowes upon it, and ſaith, <hi>Come thou ſpirit of the four winds, O Breath,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ezek. 37.9.</note> 
               <hi>and breath upon theſe ſlain and dry bones, that they may live.</hi> When the Spirit of the Lord that blows every way, and where it liſteth, comes and blows on theſe dry bones, and they heare the word of the Lord, then they are <hi>moved,</hi> and finews and nerves and fleſh come upon them, and then they are joyned together, and breath enters into them that they may live; ſo that darkneſſe is upon the <hi>Deep,</hi> and the cloud <hi>is over the Tabernacle;</hi> none can <hi>remove</hi> it, take it <hi>up,</hi> or <hi>diſperſe</hi> it, but the Lord alone. When the Lord takes away the cloud from the Tabernacle, then the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> and the MYSTERIES thereof appears; otherwiſe they are hid, and no mortall eye, nor the ſharpeſt underſtanding, nor the greateſt Scholler, nor by the uſe of all externall <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,</hi> are they able to diſcern them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, when this cloud is removed, then is the time for the ſouls of Saints to act and walk; when the cloud is <hi>upon</hi> the Tabernacle, then they ſhould <hi>ſit ſtill;</hi> and therefore
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:118719:63"/>ſaith <hi>James, We ought not</hi> (ſpeaking of the Saints) to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that,</hi> we will goe <hi>this way</hi> or <hi>that,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jam. 4.13, &amp;c.</note> threatning a woe to them that ſay <hi>To morrow we will goe to ſuch a City or place, and remain there a yeere, and there we will buy and ſell, and get gain:</hi> but we muſt from our ſoules ſay, <hi>if the Lord will;</hi> when we once come under the <hi>tuition</hi> and <hi>tutorage</hi> of the Sonne of God, and come to be <hi>of the congregation of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> then we goe not <hi>when we liſt,</hi> or <hi>would;</hi> but we are to attend <hi>the Lords hand</hi> in removing the <hi>cloud</hi> from the <hi>taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle;</hi> and if he <hi>remove</hi> it not <hi>to day,</hi> we are to ſtay till the <hi>next day;</hi> and whenſoever he removes it, then is the day of our journey and going onwards. Therefore the Apoſtle tels us of a <hi>Councellor</hi> and <hi>Leader</hi> they had; and I know alſo the world tels of a <hi>guide</hi> and <hi>rule;</hi> but it is a Rule which they themſelves know not, nor underſtand when it is croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and when tis ſtraight; but the Apoſtle tels us of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ruler, and Teacher, <hi>As many as are Chriſts, are led by the ſpirit of Chriſt.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 8.14 Acts 17.7</note> And in the <hi>Acts</hi> it is ſaid the Apoſtles would have gone into <hi>Bithynia. After they were come to Miſſia they aſsayed to goe into Bithynia,</hi> but <hi>the ſpirit ſuffered them not:</hi> for they found trouble and oppoſition: there was the Lord leading of them and guiding of them, otherwiſe they did not ſet a <hi>foot</hi> forward, their eye was ſtill upon the Lord: ſo till the cloud be <hi>removed from over the Tabernacle,</hi> the ſoule will finde nothing but <hi>trouble</hi> and <hi>deſtruction</hi> if it goe <hi>onward,</hi> and the Lord hath not <hi>diſcovered</hi> the light of the Tabernacle and himſelfe goe before it.</p>
            <p>Then in the firſt place this diſcovers to us, that there are uſually two things in the way of Chriſt which often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in the world are miſtaken, and taken one for another; there are, I ſay, the <hi>heavenly things</hi> themſelves, and there are the <hi>Patterns</hi> of them; now the <hi>Pattern</hi> is not ſet forth for it ſelfe, but in <hi>reference</hi> and <hi>Relation</hi> unto the <hi>thing</hi> of which <hi>it is a pattern;</hi> And a <hi>copy</hi> or <hi>exemplar,</hi> it is not <hi>for it ſelfe,</hi> but in relation to what we ſhould act, imitate, or doe by it: ſo there are the <hi>heavenly</hi> things themſelves, and the <hi>patterns,</hi> or <hi>types,</hi> or <hi>ſimilitudes</hi> of them; Take ſpeciall notice of theſe two things. Now we
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:118719:64"/>ſhall finde it apparent if we conſider it, that the world hath alwayes been <hi>quick-eyed</hi> to ſee the one, but not at all to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the other. The world, and eſpecially the great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſours of Religion have been <hi>quick-ſighted,</hi> to diſcern the <hi>form, pattern,</hi> and <hi>ſimilitudes</hi> of Heavenly things, and there they have been <hi>ſatisfied.</hi> But, I ſay, to <hi>find, feel,</hi> and <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy,</hi> and to <hi>live in the Heavenly things</hi> themſelves;<note place="margin">Heb. 9.23. Col. 1.26. 1 Joh. 7.6</note> this is <hi>that Myſtery that hath been hid from ages and Generations;</hi> your time that is, the time of the <hi>fleſh,</hi> is <hi>always;</hi> But <hi>My time,</hi> that is, the time of Chriſt <hi>is not always</hi> (as to man) though <hi>always</hi> (as to God) I ſay, the world in all Ages could never be found, to be without living upon and in the <hi>patterns, forms</hi> and <hi>ſhapes</hi> of <hi>Heavenly things,</hi> according as they fancied; but to find the ſons of men living <hi>in, under,</hi> and <hi>by</hi> the power of <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things</hi> themſelves, that is the <hi>Myſtery that hath,</hi> I ſay, <hi>been hidden from ages and generations,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith. We all find the <hi>Jews</hi> in the time of <hi>Moſes,</hi> they all lived under the Law <hi>in that form;</hi> they all ſaw the <hi>outward form</hi> of the Tabernacle, &amp; had a reverent eſteem of that and there reſted? And ſo how many are there now who reſt on the outward forms of <hi>wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing</hi> and <hi>dipping?</hi> &amp; theſe I take to be the <hi>Familiſts,</hi> the world ſo much hates and talks of, for they are all of this Family and Society; and herein lies ſo (far as I can ſee) their <hi>Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memberſhip</hi> which they ſo much <hi>Idolize.</hi> And for all this, how few are there of them that are of the <hi>inward</hi> aſſembly of the Saints, that <hi>are come to the general aſsembly of the Church of the firſt born which are written in Heaven;</hi> they are come and are brought but only to <hi>the mount that may not be touched and that burneth with fire,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 12.18. 22.</note> 
               <hi>and unto blackneſs, and darkneſs, and tempeſt.</hi> How many of them, I ſay, are theſe that are brought to <hi>Forms, Fellowſhips,</hi> and <hi>Waſhings,</hi> which as they are uſed, produce nothing but <hi>blackneſs,</hi> and <hi>darkneſs,</hi> and <hi>fire,</hi> and <hi>Tempeſt?</hi> (not into the Unity <hi>of that one Spirit</hi>) But Onely to be baptized with <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Cloud, and in the <hi>Sea;</hi>

Pſ. 95.11. &amp; Heb. 3:17.18.19.</note> for <hi>with many of them,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>God was not well pleaſed, whoſe Carkaſſes fell in the Wilderneſs:</hi> And the Text ſaith, <hi>they entred not into his Reſt, but were overthrown in the Wilderneſs becauſe of unbelief.</hi> Now we ſhall finde no
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:118719:64"/>age in the world, where the people have wanted their forms of things in one kind or other; but ye ſhall hardly find any age wherein people have lived under and upon the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things themſelves.</hi> How many <hi>patterns</hi> and <hi>ſimilitudes</hi> have the Papiſts in their Church? the Pope himſelf in imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Chriſt, can waſh the feet of twelve Pilgrims once in the year; and fares it any better with thoſe that call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves members of other Churches, to be only <hi>Apoſtles</hi> in imitation? ſome have one pattern, ſome another; one thinks he hath the true Baptiſme becauſe he hath the <hi>ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,</hi> and <hi>pattern</hi> of <hi>ſpiritual</hi> Baptiſm, which was then by ſome uſed by way of dipping in water, Another hath the pattern and ſimilitude of eating Chriſts Body, and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Blood in their breaking of Bread, which was but the type of the <hi>Heavenly bread</hi> that was the Body of Chriſt. But Chriſt ſaith,<note place="margin">Joh. 6.53.</note> except <hi>a man eat his fleſh and drink his blood he hath no life in him.</hi> How many Churches partake of the patterns and ſhadows and whatever they ſay, they conclude from thence they are the Church of God: becauſe ſay they, we have <hi>the right uſe of the Sacraments,</hi> which is a ſign of a <hi>true Church,</hi> becauſe they have the <hi>patterns, types,</hi> and <hi>ſhadows:</hi> obſerving onely <hi>outward</hi> rules, <hi>forms, and carnal ordinances, which all periſh with the uſing; wherefore,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Col 2.20.</note> 
               <hi>if ye be dead with Chriſt from the Rudiments of the world, why as though living in the world are ye ſubject to Ordinances?</hi> yet impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, and blaſphemouſly wil they dare to ſay they are not Church of Man, but of God: when they know not the myſtery, nor live according to the power of the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things</hi> themſelves: and therefore herein that Scripture comes to be fulfilled, <hi>that men ſhall have a form of godlineſs,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Tim. 3.5.</note> 
               <hi>but deny the power</hi> of it, for the one may be where the other is not; and the Apoſtle tells us, That <hi>he is not a</hi> Jew <hi>that is one outwardly, but he is a</hi> Jew <hi>that is one inwardly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 2.28 29.</note> whoſe <hi>circumciſion is of the heart and ſpirit, whoſe praiſe is not of men but of God.</hi> So from hence it is clear, many Churches, and many hundred thouſands of ſouls may have an exact pattern, and yet want the <hi>Heavenly things</hi> themſelves; they may have the <hi>pattern,</hi> as the <hi>Jews</hi> had, that were ſanctified
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:118719:65"/>and waſhed only with the Blood of <hi>Bulls</hi> and <hi>Goats:</hi> but to have <hi>the Heavenly things</hi> themſelves, <hi>viz.</hi> that Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Lord of life, and to have the <hi>Purifications</hi> and <hi>Sanctifications</hi> that are onely <hi>by his blood,</hi> this they are <hi>ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers</hi> to. This is the ſpiritual and living fire; and where ever it is in the ſoul of man, it cannot but <hi>break forth</hi> to the deſtroying of all things of <hi>man</hi> and <hi>fleſh,</hi> and <hi>magnifying</hi> and <hi>exalting</hi> all things of the Spirit of God.</p>
            <p>So that hence it is clear, that it would be the wiſdome of the ſons of men, to ſee whether they have the <hi>heavenly things</hi> themſelves, and not the <hi>patterns.</hi> For ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>when that which is perfect is come, then that that is imperfect ſhall be done away;</hi> and again the ſame Apoſtle; <hi>when I was a Child I did as a Child,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.11. 2 Cor. 5.16.</note> 
               <hi>I ſpake as a Child, I underſtood as a Child; but when I came to be a man, I put away childiſh things: and hence forth</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>know we Chriſt after the fleſh no more:</hi> Alas, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle had (as well as other men) known Chriſt <hi>by the way of the fleſh,</hi> and in outward conformity and obſervations, and in a <hi>low carnal</hi> apprehenſion of him; but when Chriſt was come <hi>into him</hi> in the <hi>Spirit,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. 21.5.</note> then ALL THINGS <hi>were become New:</hi> Then he would not have a Chriſtian to be judged in reſpect of a <hi>Holy-day, New Moons,</hi> or of keeping <hi>Sabbath days</hi> and the like,<note place="margin">Col. 2.16.17.</note> 
               <hi>which are but ſhadows of things to come; for the body is Chriſt.</hi> But there was a time when they were under the <hi>type</hi> of breaking of bread, which was onely to <hi>ſhew the Lords death till he came;</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.29.</note> but when Chriſt was <hi>come,</hi> then he rebukes the <hi>Corinthians</hi> for uſing that ceremony of of breaking bread, and ſaid, they <hi>did not diſcern the Lords Body.</hi> For the eating his Body, and drinking his Blood, was a thing of a far higher nature.</p>
            <p>And from hence will follow the great miſerie of the ſons of men ſeeking reſt and life in the patterns and types, and not in <hi>Heavenly things</hi> themſelves: For if a man have the exacteſt <hi>patterns,</hi> or <hi>pictures</hi> (of any <hi>meat</hi>) that ever could be drawn in the world, or of <hi>wine,</hi> and <hi>drink;</hi> would either of theſe feed or refreſh him when he was hungry, or ſatisfie him when he was thirſty? you will ſay they could not; and how then can the <hi>patterns</hi> of Heavenly things <hi>feed</hi> any
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:118719:65"/>more then they? So alſo it is the <hi>true Manna</hi> that feeds the ſoul, it is not that Manna that fell in the Wilderneſſe; <hi>your Fathers</hi> they eat <hi>of it, and are dead,</hi> ſaith our Saviour: No,<note place="margin">Joh. 6.49. 50.</note> it is the <hi>ſpiritual</hi> Manna, <hi>whereof if a man eat, he ſhall live for ever.</hi> Then it muſt needs be a deceit of the Devil, and a <hi>wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> and ſad <hi>deluſion</hi> on the ſpirits of men, and yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this is that great deluſion, wherewith Satan is gone forth to feed men, as the Prodigal was, with the husks and ſhells of Divine things. He deſired the <hi>husks</hi> and <hi>no man gave unto him;</hi> But when the poor man had waſted that <hi>por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> he had from his Father, when that <hi>divine portion</hi> was gone, and he had waſted it among <hi>Whores</hi> and <hi>Harlots,</hi> that is, after his own inventions, thinking they ſhould nouriſh him, he ſaith, he could eat Husks, But he found they would not ſatisfie; I, he ſhould ſterve for hunger; yet ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thouſands think, and accordingly <hi>do,</hi> could I go into ſuch a <hi>Church-fellowſhip,</hi> and walk <hi>as they walk,</hi> I ſhould be as well as they, and yet for all that, there is no man <hi>can give unto them;</hi> &amp; had he them to the utmoſt, alas they would not ſatisfie and fill him: But he cannot have that others have, he would have their Holineſſe, and be able to pray, hear, and ſpeak, and have as much freedome and power againſt ſin and the like but it, is not given unto him; but if he have all theſe external things, yet alas, they are but husks, and cannot ſatisfie: So that then there is a plain and abſolute neceſſity falls on him, and he ſees there is no way but <hi>to goe home to his Father,</hi> elſe he ſtarves and dyes:<note place="margin">Luk. 15.18.</note> and now he ſees his own <hi>weakneſs</hi> and <hi>poverty,</hi> then he begins <hi>to come to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> and ſaith, <hi>I will return to my Father:</hi> So when the Soul is brought into this condition, then it ſees that it is not he that hath brought things into any good frame by his good husbandry, or by a providential care: now nothing will ſerve his turn; no, I muſt to my Father, and I will goe to my Father. This ſhews the miſery of the ſpirits of thoſe men that would fain feed upon <hi>husks.</hi> And from hence it comes to paſs that they run here, and run there, from one to another, even as a poor <hi>creature</hi> when it is <hi>thirſty</hi> and <hi>drye,</hi> and ſees many Wells or Veſſels, thinking there is <hi>water:</hi> He
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:118719:66"/>runs to one to ſee if there be any, and then to another, but they are all empty. So alas, a poor <hi>hungry</hi> ſoul, here it picks, and there it feeds, and as long as it can find a <hi>crum,</hi> it will never go to God; it had rather go to any MOUN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TEBANK, then come to Jeſus Chriſt the true Phyſitian.

            <p>And again, that we may know light is not <hi>in mans hand:</hi> as <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid, <hi>Maſter, let us be here, and build three Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> &amp;c.

            <p>Further, if this Cloud be removed onely by the hand of the Lord, then I ſay, Firſt it ſhews plainly the <hi>vanity, pride, folly</hi> and <hi>uſeleſsneſs</hi> of mens labouring to remove it, in their taking upon them that which belongs to God: and Firſt, I ſay, it diſcovers that <hi>horrible Pride, Robbery, Blaſphemy, Arrogancy</hi> and <hi>Infidelity</hi> that is in the heart of man, to think he will do that which <hi>none</hi> can do but the hand of God: And 'tis <hi>Infidelity</hi> to think God will not do that he hath promiſed to do <hi>to the ends of the earth;</hi> and robbery in that

The Goſpel you ſee is a Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle that God <hi>plants</hi> and <hi>pitches,</hi> and not man; but ever and anon they will be taking upon them to do this, and then it muſt be their care to know and diſtinguiſh of <hi>blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi> and <hi>errours,</hi> and <hi>hereſies:</hi> and this they do meerly out of that <hi>principle of errour</hi> and <hi>blaſphemy</hi> that is in their own hearts; for this ſhewes their <hi>Infidelity,</hi> that God is not able to carry on his own work: And do we ſay we are Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and believe in him, and when we have ſo done, tell him <hi>a lye</hi> to his <hi>face?</hi>

               <hi>Obj.</hi> But you will ſay, if that men ſhould not do it, men

               <note place="margin">Mat. 15.13.</note> May man then root up and plant at his pleaſure? For the truth is, mans Miniſtry and Miniſters may ſend out men and plant Churches, that is, they may make PRO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SELYTES, and they may make them worſe, but can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver make them better: as the Phariſees, taking great pains that way, to furniſh men, as to imitations, notions, actions and external performances;<note place="margin">Rom. 2.28 29.</note> but to bring the heart to be a <hi>Jew inwardly,</hi> whoſe Circumciſion is of the Heart, and not of the Letter, this is that <hi>plant</hi> that is alone of the <hi>Heavenly Fathers</hi> planting, and ſhall abide: but what plant either the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> or <hi>Churches,</hi> either by excluſion or incluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on have <hi>planted,</hi> ſhall be rooted up: But what the Lord <hi>plants,</hi> what Tabernacle <hi>he pitches</hi> among poor creatures, the ſons of men that are neither cal'd by the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> or <hi>Churches,</hi> that is <hi>the Church</hi> that ſhall abide, being founded <hi>on the Rock of Ages,</hi> and ſhall ſtand for ever.</p>
            <p>Nay further, they will themſelves remove the Cloud of the Tabernacle (which God muſt do and not man) and to do this <hi>they will lay heavy burthens upon other mens ſhoulders,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 23.4</note> &amp;c. and to this end they will bring forth a Doctrine to put <hi>men</hi> upon it, teaching that men have Free will, and may believe if they will, and repent unto life; that ſo man may be perſwaded he is not fallen ſo low as ſome ſay, that he need but wipe or throw off a little the duſt off his own eyes which he got by his Fall, and then, he may ſee preſently, and uſing but his utmoſt induſtry, he may work out his own ſalvation. Alas, this is but a <hi>deluſion</hi> of Satan, to make a poor <hi>blind man</hi> rub his own eyes, and be afterward a great deal worſe. No, this is not the way; 'tis the Lord removes the <hi>Cloud,</hi> and not <hi>Man;</hi> therefore till the Lord cauſe the ſoul ſimply to <hi>go out</hi> by beleeving, there is ſtill <hi>a cloud upon the Tabernacle,</hi> and upon all thoſe <hi>Myſteries</hi> that concern Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt,<note place="margin">Eph. 4.21.</note> and they cannot ſee the <hi>truth as it is in Jeſus.</hi>

               <note place="margin">Eſa. 29.13.</note> 
               <hi>This people</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>draw too neer me with their lips, but their hearts are removed far from me:</hi> Yet more, though all mens Religion talk of God, yet you that have eyes to ſee, may ſee plainly their Hearts are on <hi>man</hi> and the creature: they talk of God, of Chriſt, of <hi>grace,</hi> of gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>knowledge,</hi> of acting by <hi>grace;</hi> and yet do but follow the point home in practice and application, and ye ſhall find theſe are all laid upon man, and in effect they ſay, <hi>man muſt</hi> remove the Covering off the <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> and he muſt by his ſtudy and pains bring down light, and life, and the like. So I ſay, though they <hi>ſay it</hi> with their <hi>mouths,</hi> their <hi>hears</hi> are <hi>far from God:</hi> So that when once man really ſees there is a Cloud upon the Tabernacle, then he looks not to the right hand, nor to the left,<note place="margin">Pſa. 121.1.</note> thinking that man ſhould remove it, but alone <hi>to the hills</hi> from whence his <hi>help</hi> and <hi>ſalvation</hi> comes: for when a man thinks his own <hi>zeal, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, duties, belief, repentance</hi> and the like be the way to remove the Cloud, thinking ſurely I ſhall remove it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, I will goe <hi>pray,</hi> and <hi>hear,</hi> and <hi>watch over</hi> my ſelfe, and keep cloſe <hi>to thoſe rules</hi> I have choſen, and then I ſhall have <hi>light</hi> and <hi>peace,</hi> and <hi>joy,</hi> and ſo remove the Cloud pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently; and ſo he is bragging and boaſting thereof in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and throwing dirt and mire upon all others that are ſhort of him as he conceives, and ſo poor man is feeding upon the <hi>dead aſhes of his own heart,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eſa. 44.20</note> and knows not <hi>that there is a lye in his RIGHT HAND;</hi> his very <hi>light</hi> is <hi>darkneſſe,</hi> and his <hi>goodneſſe ſin,</hi> and his <hi>riches beggery,</hi> and his life death, and that he holds in his <hi>right hand</hi> is a lye. <hi>And if the light that is in thee be darkneſſ, how great is that Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs?</hi> Are they <hi>repentings, beleevings, actings,</hi> and <hi>workings,</hi> (if theſe be) as thou thinkeſt, the <hi>means</hi> to remove the <hi>Cloud</hi> off the <hi>Tabernacle?</hi> is not this <hi>to truſt in man,</hi>

<pb n="116" facs="tcp:118719:71"/>ſeeing this, it cryes to, and waites upon none but God, and then indeed <hi>is the heart fixed upon him</hi> (where it ſhould be) from whom comes <hi>ſalvation</hi> and <hi>deliverance:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 57.7.</note> And whoever waited upon him that is faithful and ſtrong, and only can deliver, and was not in due time delivered?</p>
            <p>And from hence it appears, when the ſoul <hi>walks in the light,</hi> he knows <hi>full well,</hi> it will be in vain for him to think <hi>to remove the cloud</hi> till the Lord <hi>remove</hi> it. It may be the time hath been when thou haſt felt the heat of the Divine diſpleaſure, and thy ear was then boared, and thy uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed heart circumciſed, and then light appeared, and thou bleſſedeſt the Lord in that day: But now there begins to come <hi>darkneſſe</hi> over thy eyes again, and thou beginneſt to ſee thy ſelfe loſt again, and the Cloud is upon the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, and thou art gotten into the <hi>pathleſs way:</hi>

Then the poor ſoul thinks he is <hi>running to Canaan,</hi> when indeed he is going <hi>back</hi> to <hi>Egypt.</hi> And therefore it is clear to me both by the Scriptures and by the experience of the preciouſeſt Saints I ever met with, that in this condition its beſt to <hi>ſit ſtill:</hi> For <hi>he that believeth maketh not haſte,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eſa. 28.16</note> but waits till the Lord will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the cloud; but if thou wilt turn from the Lord, and go by another <hi>guide</hi> and <hi>captain,</hi> and not by that <hi>Moſes</hi> God <hi>hath ſent,</hi> and art going to make a Golden Calfe, and and Idol to go before thee: if ſo, thou mayeſt expect that <hi>thy carkaſs ſhall fall in the Wilderneſs</hi> for thy unbelief,<note place="margin">Num. 14.29.</note> and not waiting the good pleaſure of the Lord: for not one en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred the promiſed Land but <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Joſhuah:</hi> know this is the condition and diſpoſition of a Saint, that he only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyceth in the Lord; all his expectations are from him who hath made light and darkneſſe: <hi>I have learned,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">Phil. 4.11.</note>

               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 12.9, 10.</note> for he ſees this is his portion, and he cannot remove the cloud, and he is willing to ſit ſtill there till <hi>the day dawn,</hi> and the <hi>Day-ſtar ariſe</hi> in him.<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.19.

               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 12.7.</note> there was <hi>a meſſenger of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan ſent to buffet him, leaſt he ſhould be exalted above meaſure;</hi> there was again a cloud let fall over the Tabernacle, when he was in the height of his joys, <hi>a prick</hi> was ſent him, <hi>in the fleſh,</hi> a Meſſenger of Satan to <hi>buffet him:</hi> and therefore he concludes in another place, <hi>we walk by faith, and not by ſight.</hi> Tis ſo with every Chriſtian: in the day of his <hi>light,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.7</note> and the time of his <hi>greateſt</hi> ſhinings, uſually and then eſpecially there is a cloud upon the Tabernacle: <hi>why?</hi> to let man know thus much, that he muſt not <hi>live</hi> upon the GIFT but on the GIVER, that man muſt not gather to <hi>day,</hi> for ever, but he is to gather to morrow, and every day, as the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in gathering Manna: for <hi>if thou</hi> layeſt up ſtore, it will be dead the next time thou commeſt to feed on it, it will all <hi>ſtinke,</hi> and it will not nouriſh thee; but wait ſtill on <hi>the giver,</hi> and then his mercy will be <hi>ſweet, freſh, flouriſhing, and green.</hi>

            <p>Laſtly, from this that the fire ſhined on the Tabernacle by night, we ſhall onely note, that when the <hi>Light of the Tabernacle</hi> ſhines upon the ſoules of men, all things elſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come dark; tis night in that ſoule to all things but the light
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:118719:72"/>of the Tabernacle; in the night <hi>there was a fire,</hi> and in the day <hi>a cloud;</hi> now, I ſay, when the fire ſhined, all things were dark round about it: And herein obſerve theſe two things: firſt, when mans ſpirit is ſhut up, and ſees he no light, then is the time for the appearing of this light. And ſecondly, this light never appears, but when <hi>all things</hi> are dark in man; for light diſcovers darkneſſe: if any thing elſe be light to thee, and all things elſe be not <hi>darkneſſe,</hi> thou never yet <hi>diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edſt</hi> this light: To this ſoule there is nothing in the whole creation that ſeems to be <hi>glorious</hi> and <hi>excellent;</hi> but when the Sun of righteouſneſſe in him hath ſhined upon it, then it appears to be all darkneſs; when the light of the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle <hi>ſhines</hi> in the ſoule of man, then <hi>riches, honour, pleaſure, preferments,</hi> all things below God are darkneſſe: Then the light of his <hi>reaſon, wit, moralitie,</hi> and <hi>holy qualities,</hi> that ſeemed to be a great light and ſhined before glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, being compared one with another, or with things infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour; Now, when <hi>the light of the Tabernacle</hi> appeares, then <hi>all theſe</hi> things appeare to be <hi>nothing but darkneſse,</hi> emptineſs, and blindneſs, and are all as <hi>meer vapours</hi> before the <hi>Sun</hi> of righteouſneſſe, as the Prophet ſaith, <hi>Therefore thy goodneſse is as the morning dew, and as the cloud that wears away;</hi> ſo that, I ſay,<note place="margin">Hoſ. 6.4.</note> whenſoever the <hi>fire</hi> in the Tabernacle <hi>ſhines on man,</hi> then this will be the ſure effect in that ſoule, he ſhall look upon <hi>all things in himſelfe</hi> as nothing but <hi>darkneſſe;</hi> and man will then no longer <hi>call light darkneſse,</hi> nor <hi>darkneſse light,</hi> but he will ſay, Woe is me, verily I thought my <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,</hi> my <hi>holineſſe,</hi> my <hi>performances</hi> and <hi>duties,</hi> and <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippings</hi> of God, I thought theſe to be BRIGHT THINGS; but now the Lord hath appeared upon me, I ſee <hi>that all my goodneſs is as the morning dew, and as the cloud that paſseth away:</hi> And he alone is my help, my deliverer, my <hi>holineſſe,</hi> my <hi>Sanctification,</hi> and my <hi>Redemption:</hi> He alone is my ſong and my ſalvation, and of him alone will I make my boaſt.</p>

            <p>Look upon the Papiſts, and obſerve how many genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions they have ſtood in their <hi>form of worſhip,</hi> and how gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally it hath been <hi>received</hi> in one <hi>halfe</hi> of the world; yet we conclude they are no other but <hi>Idolaters.</hi> And if <hi>we</hi> ſhall examine, and bring to the <hi>touch</hi> many received <hi>opinions</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Chriſt, and concerning the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and the <hi>word of God,</hi> and <hi>waſhings,</hi> and <hi>baptizings,</hi> and <hi>breaking of bread,</hi> as they are now uſed, and as they <hi>are</hi> and have been <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally</hi> in uſe, we ſhall finde them no other but <hi>inventions of men,</hi> according as they <hi>underſtand</hi> the Scriptures, and ſay, theſe are the things themſelves, though not in words yet in their <hi>practices</hi> they ſay no leſſe, and are no other (as they uſe them) but <hi>Idols,</hi> and the work of their <hi>own</hi> hands: and
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:118719:81"/>theſe they <hi>worſhip, adore,</hi> and bleſſe themſelves in uſing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. And though they may goe ſo far, as to give the ſenſe, and hit the <hi>litterall meaning,</hi> yet they <hi>may</hi> be and <hi>are</hi> farre from the myſtery, the <hi>true</hi> meaning and <hi>the mind of Chriſt,</hi> as the Apoſtle calls it, and <hi>the knowledge of truth, as it is in Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.</hi> For if they doe <hi>hit</hi> the letter,<note place="margin">Eph. 4.21</note> and <hi>ſquare</hi> their <hi>diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline</hi> according to it, alaſs they have not the <hi>life</hi> and <hi>power</hi> for all that: they who think themſelves <hi>moſt exact,</hi> and think to <hi>hit</hi> it, and <hi>imitate</hi> it to a tittle; yet they reach but the <hi>ſhaddow</hi> and the <hi>Image,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 3.6</note> the <hi>dead</hi> letter, and not <hi>the life,</hi> and the things themſelves, for they are of a <hi>farre</hi> more excellent and <hi>ſpirituall</hi> nature, which no man (as man) could <hi>imitate</hi> nor follow, nor <hi>obſerve,</hi> but onely he who is <hi>taught of God,</hi> and that it is <hi>given him from above</hi> to believe and comprehend; for, the <hi>dead</hi> letter is not <hi>the life,</hi> but all things that the <hi>eye ſees,</hi> and the <hi>eare</hi> heares, are things that muſt <hi>paſſe away,</hi> they muſt <hi>remove,</hi> that ſo the <hi>heavenly things</hi> may come in the <hi>room</hi> thereof, even thoſe things of which all <hi>externall</hi> things are but the <hi>patterns</hi> and <hi>ſimilitudes,</hi> Even Chriſt himſelfe <hi>after the fleſh:</hi> and this is that <hi>Myſterie</hi> of Chriſt which is <hi>hid in God,</hi>

And none know this but the <hi>Church,</hi> and thoſe that are true members of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt; nay the Angels, and Principalities and Powers,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:118719:81"/>know not <hi>theſe things,</hi> which he calls the <hi>manifold</hi> wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, verſ. 10.</p>
            <p>So that in theſe words read before you, it appears to me, there is included theſe two things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, here is a deſcription of <hi>mans day,</hi> and what he doth in that <hi>his</hi> day: He gets unto himſelf <hi>Horſes</hi> of his own, and <hi>Chariots</hi> of his own, and he builds unto himſelf <hi>ſtrong Cities,</hi> and <hi>ſtrong holds;</hi> that is, places of ſecurity of his own inventing, and in <hi>that day</hi> his hand is full of <hi>Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crafts, Deluſions,</hi> and <hi>Lyes;</hi> and he gets to himſelf <hi>Southſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> and <hi>Diviners</hi> to promiſe to him peace, ſafety, and ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and in that day, he is full of <hi>graven Images</hi> of his <hi>own</hi> making, and he cleaves mightily to his <hi>old, ancient,</hi> and <hi>ſtanding</hi> Images, which both <hi>he</hi> and his <hi>forefathers</hi> have received.</p>
            <p>Secondly, here is a threatning of an approach of <hi>the day of the</hi> Lord, and that <hi>his hand</hi> ſhall be upon <hi>all</hi> theſe things: he will cut off his <hi>Horſes,</hi> and deſtroy his <hi>Chariots,</hi> and the <hi>Cities</hi> of his Land, and will throw down <hi>all his ſtrong holds,</hi> and will cut off <hi>all his Witchcrafts,</hi> and <hi>Southſayers,</hi> and <hi>gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> Images, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And however, moſt <hi>Interpreters</hi> do take this in a Litteral ſenſe onely, and look upon it as a Hiſtory of what God did <hi>outwardly</hi> and <hi>externally</hi> among the Jewes, when they were <hi>deſtroyed</hi> and carried into <hi>captivity,</hi> yet to me there is much more in it; for all thoſe relations are types of <hi>ſpiritual things; the word of the Lord enduring for ever;</hi> as David ſaith, <hi>I have ſeen an end of all perfection, but thy Law is exeecding broad:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 119.96.</note> And in this ſenſe, it is promiſed, there <hi>ſhall be no more an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanter in Iſrael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, we will endeavour to apply all this to our <hi>ſelves,</hi> and make Uſe thereof.</p>
            <p>Firſt, hence we may ſafely conclude, that <hi>all men</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſtinction, untill Chriſt be revealed in <hi>them,</hi> they are all joyned in one way of <hi>Idolatry</hi> and <hi>falſe worſhip;</hi> and that all thoſe Hiſtories and Deſcriptions of <hi>Idols</hi> and <hi>Idolaters</hi> in Scripture, are but <hi>figures</hi> of what man does <hi>in his</hi> DAY: And howerer they go not <hi>all</hi> one way, in regard of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:118719:82"/>but many <hi>cenſure</hi> and <hi>condemn</hi> each other, yet to God they are all <hi>Idolaters, Inchanters, Southſayers,</hi> &amp;c. and are <hi>gone a whoring after their own inventions,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſali 106.39.</note> and are mad af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Idols;</hi> they all have their <hi>Horſes</hi> and their <hi>Chariots,</hi> and <hi>Cities of confidence,</hi> and <hi>ſtrong holds,</hi> their <hi>Sorcerers</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanters,</hi> and follow <hi>the way of Balaam,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jer. 19.14 1 Kings. 18.18.</note> and their god ASH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TEROTH, as <hi>their Fathers have taught them.</hi> All that the ſpirit of man <hi>can find out</hi> by his own <hi>wiſdom, power,</hi> or <hi>invention</hi> is nothing but as <hi>Sauls</hi> going to <hi>Witches</hi> and <hi>Wiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards</hi> in the day of their diſtreſſe: they every one in this <hi>way</hi> leave URIM and THUMMIM which the Lord hath <hi>commanded,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 28.30. &amp; 1 Sam. 28.7.</note> and they are all going to a weak <hi>woman</hi> and one that hath <hi>a familiar</hi> ſpirit: And all this he doth by taking counſel <hi>of his own heart,</hi> and following <hi>his own</hi> inventions, and doth not wait upon that <hi>Divine teaching</hi> of the Father, and that <hi>never failing</hi> URIM and THUMMIM which the Lord himſelf hath <hi>commanded</hi> him to wait upon.</p>
            <p>All theſe inventions of man are but his <hi>Horſes</hi> and <hi>Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots</hi> to carry him away <hi>ſwiftly</hi> from his enemies and purſuers; when conſcience is <hi>awaked</hi> in man, and he begins to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend <hi>wrath</hi> and <hi>vengeance,</hi> and ſees what a <hi>vile, ugly</hi> crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture he is, and what <hi>wayes</hi> he hath taken, and how he hath followed after <hi>witches</hi> and <hi>wizzards</hi> to enquire of them, who have <hi>made lyes their refuge;</hi> now man gets to himſelfe all the <hi>refuges, defences,</hi> and <hi>deliverers</hi> he can poſſibly, to ſave him from <hi>this wrath to come;</hi>

            <p>From hence then we may hold out thus much, and 'tis very clear.

            <p>But till <hi>this day of the Lord</hi> come, and this <hi>great light</hi> ſhine round about him, man rides on boldly and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently as Saul to <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> and is not <hi>ſmitten down</hi> from his Horſe, neither ſees he what he is <hi>doing,</hi>

            <p>But oh! how tart and harſh is this Doctrine to all the <hi>wiſe, ſober, grave, holy</hi> and <hi>learned men</hi> of the world! Oh how do they <hi>hate</hi> and <hi>deride</hi> this Doctrine! But let me tell them <hi>before the Lord, Angels and Men,</hi> That for all this while they are bleſſing themſelves,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 4.9.</note> from the <hi>Devil</hi> and <hi>Antichriſt</hi> and the reſt, and ſcorning theſe things ſhould be in <hi>them</hi> and
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:118719:94"/>think that they have <hi>diſcovered them</hi> here and there; <hi>Behold</hi> they are <hi>nigh them,</hi> they are <hi>within them,</hi> in their hearts and mouths, though they ſee them not. But if ever with all thy <hi>learning,</hi> and <hi>parts,</hi> and <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> thou hadſt had but the light of God in thee, it would have ſhewed thee the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi> and the <hi>true Necromancer,</hi> and let thee know that <hi>for all thy vain boaſting,</hi> and ſwelling, and <hi>high,</hi> and <hi>proud</hi> conceits of thy ſelfe, that thou never yet hadſt the light of God, and that God never yet anſwered thee by that <hi>true</hi> URIM and THUMMIM,<note place="margin">Exod. 28.30,</note> where thou oughteſt to <hi>enquire,</hi> but thou haſt ſtill <hi>enquired</hi> of BAAL and ASHTEROTH, and of <hi>Wizzards</hi> and <hi>familiar Spirits,</hi> and the Counſels of thine own heart; otherwiſe, all thy high <hi>conceits</hi> had been laid <hi>low:</hi> but thou goeſt out to <hi>Sorcerers,</hi> and <hi>Southſayers,</hi> to ASHDOD or any thing, and conſulteſt with them, and they tell thee of <hi>a thouſand Devils</hi> but themſelves; and they will tell thee thou art a <hi>wiſe,</hi> a <hi>godly,</hi> a <hi>holy man;</hi> who more holy? nay, that thou art a Saint, and all others, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially ſuch and ſuch are Devils to thee: this man ſees e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing <hi>naught,</hi> and <hi>evil,</hi> and <hi>out of order,</hi> but in his own heart. And what <hi>deep</hi> and <hi>deſperate</hi> Witchcraft, and Lyes are theſe, when all theſe are <hi>in himſelf?</hi> But when Chriſt comes, then the mind is quite <hi>turnd, altered,</hi> and <hi>changed;</hi> then he ſees that HIS <hi>heart</hi> is deceitfull above all things; then he is <hi>amazed to ſee</hi> thoſe <hi>unſpeakable</hi> deceits that are there, how <hi>loathſome</hi> and vile he is, then he wonders that Chriſt ſhould deſcend <hi>ſo low as Hell,</hi> to bring his ſoule out thence: then he ſees how all thoſe things which before <hi>he would never beleeve</hi> to be in him, they are now <hi>laid open,</hi> and now he ſees that Chriſt is Hee alone that hath led Captivity Captive.</p>
            <p>Secondly, this Doctrine notes out unto us <hi>the vanity</hi> of the minds of <hi>all men,</hi> while they are anywhere <hi>exerciſed</hi> but within themſelves, in their <hi>own hearts:</hi> for all good and evil comes out of the heart, and 'tis <hi>that</hi> which cometh out thence which <hi>defileth the man:</hi> And again, <hi>a good man out of the good treaſure of his heart bringeth good things;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 12.35.</note> but <hi>an evil man out of the evil treaſure of his heart, bringeth forth
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:118719:94"/>evil things.</hi> Therefore the maine of all is to know a mans ſelfe; for a man to have <hi>high</hi> and great thoughts of <hi>himſelf,</hi> and in the mean time to be no other but a <hi>Devil,</hi> a <hi>Wizzard,</hi> a <hi>Sorcerer,</hi> to be an enemy, and a <hi>deluder</hi> to himſelf, to think himſelf to be in <hi>light</hi> when he is in <hi>thick darkneſſe,</hi> to call in himſelf <hi>evil good, and good evil, darkneſs light, and light darkneſs:</hi> This is one of the Devils <hi>great</hi> Deluſions,<note place="margin">Exo. 10.21 Eſa. 5.20.</note> and Witchcrafts in man, to carry him <hi>ſtill</hi> out of himſelfe, even in point of Religion to look <hi>abroad</hi> and meddle with <hi>this man</hi> and the <hi>other man,</hi> and neglect himſelfe; other mens faults are <hi>heynous,</hi> but he neither <hi>ſees</hi> nor once finds fault with his own: Some men alſo are much carried out in company, and are full of talk and <hi>high</hi> diſcourſes, and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <hi>notions,</hi> and theſe they trade withall and think to be Somebody, and get themſelves a name; and all theſe things tend to <hi>this main end,</hi> to make man ſeem to be what he is not, <hi>ſomething when he is nothing,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks,<note place="margin">Gal. 6.3.</note> and to cover and hide theſe <hi>Devils,</hi> theſe <hi>Witchcrafts,</hi> theſe <hi>Sorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> theſe <hi>Inchantments</hi> from his own and others beholding; If the <hi>Devil</hi> can but <hi>hide</hi> himſelfe that he be not known <hi>to be</hi> as he is, he knows he ſhall reſt <hi>ſecure</hi> enough; then the ſoul is quiet enough, and thinks <hi>all is well,</hi> and ſo the man ſleeps in the Devils <hi>arms,</hi> and knows nothing of his own miſery, until he lie down in <hi>ſorrow,</hi> and <hi>condemnation</hi> with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil for ever; and this is that which the Divel labours to do in man <hi>with all his might:</hi> This <hi>hiding</hi> and <hi>eovering,</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luding</hi> is meerly the work of the Devil. Now the work of Chriſt is to <hi>undermine</hi> and to <hi>Counter-work</hi> all this, <hi>viz.</hi> by diſcovering and laying open all theſe miſchiefs and deceits, and by letting man ſee his <hi>own folly, deluſion,</hi> and <hi>miſery;</hi> for the Devil would <hi>by no means</hi> be diſcovered, leaſt he ſhould be <hi>caſt out;</hi> Therefore he cannot abide <hi>that man ſhould dwell at home,</hi> and be over <hi>buſie</hi> with his own heart, to ſee the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantments,</hi> and <hi>cheatings</hi> that are there: For, there it is the Prince of Darkneſſe <hi>rules,</hi> and fits <hi>as King</hi> of the Bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe pit, and he knows he can delude and deceive, and be <hi>too hard</hi> for all the men in the world, except Jeſus Chriſt undertake to uncover and unmask his deluſions.</p>
            <pb n="164" facs="tcp:118719:95"/>
            <p>But when Chriſt will <hi>diſcover him</hi> in thee, then thou ſhalt ſee thy ſelfe to be <hi>all theſe things</hi> that we have ſpoken, and that all thoſe <hi>lying Divinations</hi> are in thee; then all thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits and <hi>lyes</hi> ſhall lie under the <hi>ſentence</hi> of condemnation; then and never before, canſt thou diſcover or bear witneſſe againſt <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> and the <hi>Prince</hi> of Darkneſſe; then thou ſhalt come to know whether thou art indeed a member of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>viz.</hi> by finding theſe <hi>diſcoveries</hi> to be made <hi>in thee;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 16.17.</note> for then thou canſt <hi>witneſſe</hi> that <hi>fleſh and blood never revealed theſe things to thee.</hi> Then thou ſhalt ſee experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally, what it is to be <hi>in captivity,</hi> what it is to be in Egypt, in Babylon, and that thou waſt in ſuch <hi>cruel</hi> bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage once, and bound with ſuch <hi>ſtrong</hi> fetters, as no hand could deliver thee, but onely the hand of the <hi>meer mercy</hi> of God: and that it is that onely which maketh thee to <hi>differ,</hi> and not any power, wiſdom, or watchfulneſſe of thine own: nothing but that Almighty hand hath delivered thee from the <hi>Witch,</hi> and the <hi>Deluder,</hi> and the <hi>Sorcerer,</hi> and <hi>deſtroyed the Deſtroyer,</hi> and all this out of <hi>meer mercy</hi> and good will to thee.</p>
            <p>And then alſo this will follow, if thou haſt found theſe things <hi>done,</hi> and acted <hi>in thy ſelf,</hi> thou canſt not chuſe but <hi>pitty</hi> and <hi>pray</hi> for all thoſe who are yet under <hi>the ſame In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When thou beholdeſt them, thou canſt not chuſe but ſay, alas <hi>poor-ſoules!</hi> I know full well that there is none but only the hand of Jeſus Chriſt that can help and deliver them; I was in the ſame condition; what was I more then they, that <hi>ſo much mercy</hi> hath been ſhewed to me? and in ſeeing <hi>their</hi> miſery, thou canſt not but remember <hi>thine own,</hi> and ſo thou ſeeſt thy <hi>ſelf</hi> in ſeeing them: This the Apoſtles did when they beheld others: they confeſſed <hi>that they were by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Children of wrath as well as others:</hi> 'Tis onely the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God that pulls <hi>thee as a brand out of the fire,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. 2.3. Zach. 3.7.

               <note place="margin">Mark 5.9.</note> and knowing all theſe LEGI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ONS of Devils caſt out of thee, thou wilt be ſo far from <hi>inſulting</hi> and <hi>upbraiding</hi> any in this condition, that thou wilt pitty them <hi>in thy very ſoul,</hi> from a <hi>fellow-feeling</hi> of the ſame miſery.</p>
            <p>Again farther, this will be another <hi>effect:</hi> If <hi>Satan</hi> and <hi>Antichriſt</hi> be diſcovered and caſt out in thee, it will bring thee not to wonder to ſee ſuch infinite multitudes of men carried away with the ſpirit of <hi>Inchantment,</hi> and <hi>Deluſion,</hi> for tis a wonder <hi>any one</hi> is brought from under theſe deluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.

               <note place="margin">2.

            <p>But all this is but [MAN] <hi>Man</hi> in the beginning, and <hi>Man</hi> in the middle, and <hi>Man</hi> in the end: For this man was never <hi>fetcht out of him ſelf:</hi> never yet ſaw the <hi>abominations</hi> of his own heart,<note place="margin">Ezek. 20.43.</note> never yet <hi>loathed himſelf;</hi> and how can any thing of God come from him, who never in himſelf had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing of God, but all his <hi>actings</hi> were from man, and from <hi>ſelf,</hi> and from <hi>parts</hi> gained and acquired by his own diligence and improvement?<note place="margin">Mat. 7.16.</note> and <hi>do men gather Grapes of Thorns, or Figs of Thiſtles?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From hence alſo tis farther <hi>clear,</hi> that all <hi>Charmes, Lyes, Inchantments, Sorceries,</hi> and all the <hi>ſecret workings</hi> of Satan and Antichriſt lie hid and <hi>undiſcovered</hi> until the day of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt; for Satan will never diſcover himſelf, <hi>Belzebub</hi> will never really caſt out <hi>Belzebub,</hi>

               <hi>the Chriſt;</hi> and this is the <hi>grand</hi> policy of the Devil' who hath wonderfully prevailed in the world <hi>upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count;</hi> True, Chriſt is <hi>the Devil</hi> to the world, and to all <hi>falſe</hi> Profeſſours: and the working of <hi>man</hi> and ſelf, and of the Devil in man, this is received as <hi>the Chriſt;</hi> and this is in ſuch a white and glorious and innocent Devil to the world that not all the men in the world, nor all out of Chriſt, could never have diſcovered him <hi>convincingly,</hi> or caſt him out; tis only the finger of God that <hi>diſcovers,</hi> cuts off, and <hi>deſtroyes</hi> this witchcraft from among us.</p>
            <p>But, ſo this Devil may not be caſt out, he will ſhift any way to ſave himſelf, he will take up any <hi>form,</hi> any way to <hi>worſhip</hi> Chriſt, be conformable to any <hi>external</hi> thing, being no other but falſe Apoſtles; And <hi>his Miniſters ſhall be Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of righteouſnes,</hi> though they be <hi>deceitful workers, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming themſelves into the very likeneſſe of the Apoſtles of Chriſt:</hi> as they are called in the Corinthians, 2 Cor. 11.13, 14, 15. <hi>And no marvaile: for Satan himſel will transform himſelf into an Angel of light.</hi>

            <p>Again, this wiſdome <hi>from beneath,</hi> its very full of <hi>judging,</hi>

No no; the property of Divine Wiſdome is to become <hi>humble,</hi> to lay aſide all things of <hi>ſelf</hi> and <hi>fleſh,</hi> and to become <hi>teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,</hi> and <hi>nothing</hi> in its own <hi>power</hi> or <hi>wiſdom.</hi> This is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of <hi>Divine Wiſdome</hi> in man; but when man would <hi>act,</hi> and be <hi>Something,</hi> and undertake to obſerve <hi>this rule</hi> and the other, and they can undertake (the alone work of the ſpirit) <hi>to lead men into all truth</hi> before Chriſt comes in by his <hi>light, power,</hi> and <hi>wiſdome,</hi>

            <p>Now in nothing doth the Devil more delude men then in theſe things, calling them the Ordinances of Chriſt, when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they are not.

               <hi>and howſayeſt thou, ye ſhall be made free?</hi> Now indeed there was a kind of truth in it, that they were the <hi>fleſhly ſeed of Abraham,</hi> and they had ſubmitted to <hi>Circumciſion</hi> and to thoſe external iules commanded; and this ſeemed to be ſomewhat, as to outward appeanance, as if they were <hi>the true ſeed</hi> of Abraham: but that was not it: and they had <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> and yet were not <hi>Circumciſed in heart;</hi> neither were they his <hi>true</hi> ſeed.</p>

            <p>And farther, know this that when the appearance <hi>of the power</hi> of Chriſt comes into the ſoul: that is, when the <hi>Bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman</hi> and <hi>her ſon</hi> is caſt out, then the ſoul doth not as ſome imagine and teach, <hi>work out</hi> its own liberty, nor is it made free by its <hi>own</hi> power,<note place="margin">Ibid, 5.1</note> but Chriſt brings in this <hi>liberty</hi> with him, and from this <hi>liberty</hi> the ſoule acts and works.

               <note place="margin">Eph. 4, 24.</note> And there is nothing can <hi>thrive</hi> or <hi>flouriſh</hi> but onely this, which is onely planted <hi>by God himſelf:</hi> every other plant <hi>muſt be rooted up:</hi> this <hi>new man</hi> is of God, <hi>ſpiritualized,</hi> like himſelf, of his own <hi>nature,</hi> and it knows and underſtands <hi>the things</hi> of God; let there be a <hi>thouſand</hi> Religions in the world, yet onely <hi>that which</hi> the Father hath <hi>planted,</hi> and is <hi>from Heaven,</hi> that alone ſhall ſtand.</p>
            <p>I would, for <hi>teſtimony</hi> to this truth, refer you to two or three places of <hi>Scripture</hi> to conſider of: I will not name nor multiply <hi>many;</hi> for I will not <hi>weary you</hi> with tumbling over the Letter (as the manner of ſome is) neither is it of much uſe, or of any <hi>proof,</hi> or <hi>convincement</hi> to any, but thoſe who have <hi>the things themſelves</hi> made good <hi>in them.</hi> Take that in <hi>John</hi> 15.1, 2.<note place="margin">Joh. 15.1, 2.</note> There is the ſame ſimilitude uſed as is here: <hi>I am the true Vine, and my Father is the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. Every branch in me which beareth not fruit, he taketh away: and every branch which beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit.</hi> So that this ſhews that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt is the <hi>onely vine,</hi> and his father onely <hi>minds</hi> and <hi>husbands</hi> this <hi>Vine</hi> and every <hi>branch</hi> in it, for the <hi>root</hi> and <hi>branches</hi> are all but ONE <hi>Vine;</hi> and the Father, <hi>he alone</hi> hath planted it, and he <hi>dreſſeth</hi> it, and <hi>waters</hi> it, and <hi>prunes</hi> it. Jeſus Chriſt <hi>in himſelfe</hi> and <hi>members,</hi> he is the <hi>true root of Jeſse</hi> whom the Lord will <hi>eſtabliſh</hi> upon the Throne <hi>for ever:</hi> And tis onely the root of <hi>David</hi> that hath prevailed,<note place="margin">Rom. 15.12. &amp; Eſa. 11.10.</note> and no other: All other <hi>Vines</hi> are as a <hi>wilde Olive,</hi> and bear no fruit <hi>in him,</hi> and therefore muſt be <hi>taken away</hi> and cut off: for <hi>except they abide</hi> in him, they cannot <hi>bring</hi> forth fruit; <hi>Without me you can do nothing.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 15.4, 5.</note> That which is a <hi>wild vine</hi> or a <hi>wild Olive,</hi> it bears no <hi>good</hi> fruit: therefore men <hi>reject</hi> it and root it up as good for nothing but to <hi>caſt into the fire</hi> to burn: and ſo doth <hi>the Heavenly</hi> Husband man <hi>reject,</hi> whatever

               <note place="margin">Eph. 5.30.</note> So that by this <hi>place</hi> you may ſee that the <hi>Heavenly</hi> Father is the <hi>true</hi> Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man: and the onely <hi>true plant</hi> is Jeſus Chriſt: and every one which beareth <hi>true</hi> fruit, they are <hi>branches</hi> proceeding and growing <hi>in</hi> and from this <hi>root.</hi>

               <hi>and eſtabliſhed, and bring forth more fruit.</hi> And this Vine is but <hi>ONE,</hi> and <hi>the leaves thereof are appointed for the healing of the Nations,</hi> and there is no other. Thirdly, we ſhewed
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:118719:115"/>
               <hi>how tis the Lord alone who plants it, and not man:</hi> All the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions, wiſedome, and induſtry of men can do <hi>nothing at all,</hi> either in <hi>chuſing</hi> or <hi>planting</hi> of the <hi>choice</hi> Vine: neither can they cauſe it to <hi>grow</hi> or <hi>increaſe</hi> in the leaſt, but God the Father is alone <hi>the Husbandman: He</hi> it is that <hi>plants</hi> it, <hi>waters</hi> it, <hi>tends</hi> it, <hi>nouriſhes</hi> and <hi>cheriſhes</hi> it; and the Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, Care, Power, Providence of man hath no <hi>hand at all</hi> therein.

            </p>
            <p>Then if it be ſo, as moſt certainly it is, that there is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther plant <hi>accepted</hi> of the Father; and that Chriſt alone is the <hi>true Vine,</hi> and every branch muſt be <hi>ingraffed into him,</hi> and they can have no nouriſhment any <hi>other way,</hi> nor in no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>root;</hi> and that all that are in him are <hi>his Body</hi> and <hi>members</hi> of him,<note place="margin">Eph. 5.30.</note> 
               <hi>bone of his bone, and fleſh of his fleſh:</hi> I ſay, if this be truth, and truth undeniable, then let us hold to this for truth, in <hi>practice</hi> as well as in <hi>words,</hi> and not bring in the devices of the <hi>dark</hi> and <hi>ignorant</hi> ſons of men; that <hi>man</hi> may chuſe this <hi>plant</hi> by the power of himſelfe, and by his <hi>own</hi> wiſedom, and he may plant Jeſus Chriſt in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and <hi>cleave</hi> unto him: or at leaſt (ſay others) if he be once <hi>given</hi> (in their conceit) then man muſt do <hi>his</hi> part, to <hi>water,</hi> and <hi>cheriſh</hi> and <hi>nouriſh</hi> this plant: and what <hi>He</hi> judgeth to be a <hi>wild</hi> branch, or a <hi>dead</hi> joint, he may <hi>prune</hi> and cut it off, when as the Heavenly Father hath <hi>undertaken</hi> that work <hi>himſelf,</hi> and <hi>blind</hi> Man ſhall not undertake his work, and go about to prevent his <hi>power</hi> and <hi>wiſdome</hi> and <hi>Allſufficiency</hi> in carrying on and nurſing up this plant.</p>
            <p>And let us conſider <hi>ſeriouſly</hi> of this, who it is thaat under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes this <hi>high</hi> and <hi>Heavenly</hi> work: certainly tis the Lord, tis the the Lord that <hi>chuſeth</hi> it, and <hi>plants</hi> and <hi>ingraffs</hi> it: Alas the beſt of the ſons of men with all their <hi>wiſdom, power</hi> and <hi>parts,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 21.20</note> are no better then <hi>wild Olives,</hi> nay they are all that <hi>Fig-tree</hi> to which Chriſt came and could find nothing but

               <hi>leaves,</hi> and therefore <hi>curſed</hi> it, and no fruit ever did, nor <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> ſhall grow on that root.

            <p>And conſider further if it be ſo, that the Heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath taken this work <hi>upon himſelf,</hi> and quite excluded all other <hi>power, wiſdom, help;</hi> then what hath any of the ſons of men to do to undertake to <hi>prune,</hi> to <hi>judge,</hi> to <hi>cenſure,</hi> to <hi>cut off?</hi> certainly it muſt not, nor cannot be done by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other <hi>hand</hi> but by his who ingraffs; The ſame hand that <hi>ingraffs,</hi> and <hi>plants</hi> muſt onely <hi>pluck up:</hi> For, is poor ignorant <hi>man</hi> fit be to judge in this caſe? If it ſhould be <hi>left</hi> to man, he would pull up the <hi>Wheat</hi> with the <hi>Tares;</hi> nay, ſuch is his <hi>ignorance</hi> and <hi>depravedneſs,</hi> that he would take <hi>Wheat</hi> for <hi>Tares,</hi> and <hi>Tares</hi> for <hi>Wheat;</hi> and indeed this hath been the <hi>miſery of all ages,</hi> men thinking themſelves <hi>able to judge</hi> of truth, and the things of God, what's <hi>truth,</hi> and what's <hi>errour,</hi> although himſelf was never yet <hi>purged,</hi> nor never freed from his <hi>own</hi> defilements; vain, ſilly, and yet <hi>proud</hi> man, who cannot give a reaſon in the <hi>ordinary</hi> things of nature, nor give a reaſon of any colour, as why the graſs is <hi>green,</hi> or why the <hi>crow</hi> is black, or the like, which is within his own <hi>ſphear</hi> and compaſſe, and yet <hi>ſo proud,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited, and <hi>preſumptuous</hi> is he, that he will undertake to Judge of <hi>Heavenly</hi> things, and to <hi>ſift out</hi> errour from truth, and <hi>root</hi> up, and <hi>plant,</hi> and doe what <hi>he</hi> plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth.</p>

               <pb n="227" facs="tcp:118719:126"/>from which all men work, either from <hi>Chriſt</hi> or <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> either from the <hi>bondwoman</hi> or the <hi>free woman:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jam. 3.15.</note> either from <hi>the wiſdom that is above, which is pure, peaceable, gentle, eaſie te be intreated, full of mercy and good works, without partiality, without hypocriſie:</hi> Or elſe, tis <hi>from the wiſdome which is from beneath, which is earthly, ſenſual and diveliſh,</hi> which is <hi>full of envying, ſtrife, and confuſion, and every evil work.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And though this <hi>wiſdom</hi> of the world will <hi>undertake</hi> to ſhew us Chriſt, and the <hi>true</hi> bread, and they cry <hi>Loe here, and loe there,</hi> he is in our way, ſayeth every ſeveral <hi>ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> But, if they ſay <hi>he is in the wilderneſs, or he is in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret chambers, goe not after them;</hi>

               <hi>The Kingdom of God is within you.</hi> All men that think to be helped by <hi>cleaving</hi> to this Church, or that Fellowſhip, and are ſtill going <hi>out of themſelves</hi> to finde Chriſt, they are deceived; but if any man direct you to finde Chriſt anywhere but <hi>within,</hi> in his own heart, he is deceived; all theſe waies are <hi>enſnarements</hi> and <hi>deluſions,</hi> if men think to be helped by <hi>any thing</hi> in heaven or earth, but only by the <hi>pure, perfect,</hi> and <hi>alſufficient</hi> righteouſneſſe of Jeſus Chriſt, which is onely <hi>manifeſted</hi> in thy heart by his <hi>own</hi> ſpirit: for if thou thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt that Jeſus Chriſt <hi>Externall in the fleſh,</hi> as dying at <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> will help thee, thou art utterly deceived; tis Chriſt Onely who is <hi>begotten within thee;</hi> all other waies of mens deviſing, are meer <hi>lyes,</hi> deluſions, and <hi>enſnarements.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the words (for order ſake onely) take notice of theſe foure things: 1. That the ſtate of a <hi>believing ſoule</hi> is a ſtate of <hi>liberty.</hi> 2. That <hi>believers</hi> are onely made partakers of <hi>this liberty</hi> by Jeſus Chriſt. 3. That the ſafety <hi>of ſtanding</hi> is only in <hi>abiding</hi> in this liberty and freedom. 4. That when any man goes out from <hi>this liberty</hi> and <hi>freedom</hi> by Jeſus Chriſt to any thing elſe <hi>whatſoever,</hi> he goes out to be <hi>enſnared</hi> and <hi>entangled,</hi> and it cannot be otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>For the two firſt, tis cleare, that there is a ſtate of <hi>freedom</hi> and <hi>liberty</hi> belonging to the people of God: and that Chriſt
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:118719:127"/>only is their deliverer; <hi>He</hi> who is delivered by Jeſus Chriſt, he <hi>onely</hi> hath true <hi>freedom,</hi> and he is the <hi>true free man;</hi> all other, however they talk of <hi>freedom,</hi> and boaſt of <hi>freedom,</hi> if Chriſt doe not ſet them free, they are ſtill <hi>bondmen,</hi> they are ſtill in <hi>ſnares,</hi> and lockt faſt in their <hi>fetters:</hi> for, who elſe can deliver and ſet free <hi>the ſoule of man,</hi> but he that is <hi>Lord of all,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. 1.18.</note> and is ſubject to none? <hi>He alone hath the keyes of Hell and death;</hi> he alone is the ſoules <hi>Captaine</hi> and deliverer; This is that which all the Saints have experience of, when they finde themſelves delivered from the bondage of <hi>fleſh,</hi> of <hi>ſelfe,</hi> of the <hi>world;</hi> if they <hi>feel</hi> this work done within them, they know <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimentally</hi> tis the very <hi>finger</hi> and <hi>power</hi> of Chriſt, and that he is only Chriſts <hi>free man;</hi> that none hath brought it to paſs, to ſet them at <hi>liberty,</hi> to knock off <hi>their chains,</hi> and lead them out of <hi>priſon,</hi> and ſet their feet <hi>upon a rock,</hi> but only the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty <hi>power</hi> and meer <hi>mercy</hi> of the Lord Jeſus; they know that it hath been <hi>he</hi> that hath <hi>opened</hi> their eyes and their eares,<note place="margin">Pſal. 40.2.</note> that hath raiſed them from <hi>death,</hi> and given them <hi>feet</hi> to walk; and there is none know this truly, but only thoſe that <hi>feele</hi> it done in themſelves.</p>
            <p>And for proofe of this point, though I might prove it by <hi>Scripture</hi> very pleatifully, to ſhew how many, yea all the <hi>Saints</hi> there ſpoken of, have found it in their <hi>own</hi> experience that they were delivered from <hi>death,</hi> and from <hi>priſon,</hi> by the <hi>power</hi> of God, and by the hand of Jeſus Chriſt; yet what is this to thee, except thou ſinde <hi>their</hi> experience true <hi>in thy ſelfe?</hi> elſe their experience is but <hi>notions</hi> and riddles to thee, and ſuch things whereof thou haſt <hi>no knowledge,</hi> except thou <hi>ſee</hi> and <hi>know</hi> thy ſelfe to be under <hi>deth,</hi> and kept faſt in <hi>priſon;</hi> and except thou haſt found Jeſus Chriſt <hi>reſtoring,</hi> recovering, <hi>delivering</hi> and redeeming thee from <hi>this</hi> death; And that thou findeſt that he hath ſaid to thy ſoule, <hi>Ariſe and ſtand up on the feet,</hi>

Therefore Chriſt is not Salvation nor Deliverance to them: <hi>Maſter, we have eaten and drank in thy preſence, we have preacht and caſt out Devils in thy Name;</hi>

               <pb n="238" facs="tcp:118719:132"/>and makes us <hi>free indeed:</hi> elſe tis not <hi>freedom indeed;</hi> tis but the <hi>profeſſion</hi> and the ſhew; but it muſt be even the ſame <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty power</hi> that raiſed up Jeſus Chriſt <hi>from the dead,</hi> we having the <hi>ſame ſpirit of faith,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaith 2 Cor. 4.13, 14. <hi>knowing that he that raiſed the Lord Ieſus, ſhall raiſe us up,</hi>

            <p>This is the word of the Lord concerning you, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 1.10. &amp;c. <hi>Hear ye the word of the Lord ye Rulers of Sodom, and give ear to the Law of our God ye people of Gomorrah.</hi> Why <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah?</hi> He ſpeakes to <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in the firſt verſ: But becauſe they were no other to him, but were <hi>as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane</hi> as <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> for all their <hi>Sacrifices, Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths, Prayers, New Moons:</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 1.11, 12, 13, 14, 15. <hi>To what purpoſe is the multitude of your Sacrifices unto me, ſaith the Lord?

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Find a Book lately publiſhed, called <hi>The Modern Stateſman,</hi> by one who ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes his <hi>name</hi> by two letters <hi>G.

            <p>This man <hi>pretends</hi> to anſwer to ſome <hi>Objections</hi> againſt <hi>Learning</hi> in a Book of mine, entitled. <hi>The Saints Guide,</hi> in his 15. chap. pag. 109.</p>
            <p>And firſt mark his <hi>miſtakes</hi> in the contents of his
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:118719:156"/>
               <hi>Chapter;</hi> For he ſaith it is <hi>an anſwer</hi> to ſome Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in my book Againſt <hi>Learning;</hi> now in my book there is <hi>The clear definition</hi> of Learning and the <hi>diviſion;</hi> alſo a plain <hi>poſition</hi> laid down, and five <hi>arguments</hi> to make good the ſeveral <hi>branches</hi> thereof; and afterwards two <hi>Objections</hi> anſwered; and ſure this is <hi>ſomething</hi> more (if the man under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand <hi>his own</hi> terms) then <hi>ſome Objections</hi> barely and no more; yet the man is ſo <hi>wiſe,</hi> that he <hi>dare not</hi> meddle with the <hi>Poſition,</hi> nor any one of the ſingle <hi>Arguments,</hi> but only <hi>ſnatcheth</hi> at one of my <hi>Queries,</hi> and <hi>fixeth</hi> on a <hi>hint</hi> in my firſt <hi>ſolution.</hi> A bold Adverſary that <hi>bites</hi> behinde, but dares not <hi>grapple</hi> face to face.</p>
            <p>Secondly, there is nothing at all in my Book <hi>ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken</hi> or <hi>argued</hi> againſt <hi>Learning</hi> under a general <hi>term</hi> or <hi>acceptation,</hi> but with <hi>limitation;</hi> and yet this man makes his <hi>Arguments</hi> againſt me, as though I had <hi>oppoſed</hi> learning <hi>ſimpliciter,</hi> when all that I ſay is but <hi>ſecundum quid;</hi> But doubtleſſe <hi>the man</hi> will prove <hi>A great Logician,</hi> he begins ſo learnedly.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, there is <hi>nothing</hi> in my Book ſpoken <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt</hi> Humane learning neither in any <hi>general</hi> way, but under a <hi>preciſe</hi> reſpect, and punctual <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriction,</hi> as it cannot <hi>per ſe &amp; ex propriâ naturâ,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, nor apprehend <hi>the Myſtery</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> nor any way <hi>of its own nature</hi> be advantagious unto it; and this it holdeth out, not in an <hi>abſtract</hi> noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but in a <hi>concrete</hi> Conſideration: yet the man (as <hi>Lucian</hi> ſaith of <hi>fortune</hi> and <hi>folly</hi> like a <hi>mad, blind</hi> perſon, <hi>laies about him,</hi> not caring nor ſeeing where he <hi>ſmites</hi> or <hi>wounds,</hi> and anſwers as though
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:118719:156"/>I had argued <hi>againſt</hi> Learning in general; which how falſe, is <hi>evidently</hi> manifeſt; thus the man hath made <hi>a Giant of ſtraw,</hi> and will now <hi>Combat</hi> with him when he hath done; doubtleſſe here will be good <hi>game;</hi> ecce, <hi>Don Quixot</hi> and his <hi>Wind-Mils.</hi>

               <note place="margin">Rev. 12.10.</note> and ſo is he, in theſe <hi>forecited</hi> words; he is alſo a <hi>father</hi> of
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:118719:157"/>Untruths; Neither He, nor any in the Nation can juſtly <hi>make it forth</hi> that I am <hi>any way</hi> guilty of <hi>turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency</hi> of ſpirit, either to <hi>ſhame</hi> or <hi>ruine</hi> my country; and for Satan, <hi>He was a lyar from the beginning, and abode not in the truth:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh 8.44.</note> But I can witneſſe the truth of <hi>his Author</hi> in himſelfe; for if he had not been of a <hi>turbulent</hi> ſpirit, he would never have <hi>began,</hi> nor <hi>proceeded</hi> ſo boyſterouſly nor <hi>uncivilly;</hi> And if He be not the <hi>ſhame</hi> of the Gowne, or Pulpit, I am ſure he is <hi>of the Preſſe,</hi> that may well <hi>bluſh</hi> with thoſe <hi>malicious</hi> falſities that he hath <hi>publiſhed</hi> againſt me who never <hi>thought,</hi> nor did him <hi>iujury.</hi> Doth his <hi>learning</hi> or <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> teach him theſe things? <hi>The lips of truth ſhall be eſtabliſhed for ever:</hi>

            <p>And His firſt entrance is ſtill like himſelfe, <hi>full of poyſon</hi> and evil <hi>words:</hi> He ſaith, it is a <hi>Quaery</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan himſelf might <hi>bluſh</hi> to put.

               <pb n="289" facs="tcp:118719:157"/>and <hi>to hold faſt that which is good:</hi> and that the <hi>wolfe</hi> cloaths himſelfe in the <hi>lambs skin,</hi> is witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>in himſelfe,</hi> whoſe <hi>wolfiſh</hi> nature appears in his <hi>malicious, devouring</hi> language, though he would <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorne</hi> it with the <hi>ſpecious</hi> pretext of being a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an. And then he proceeds ſtill in that <hi>work</hi> which his Maſter <hi>the Prince of darkneſſe</hi> hath ſet him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; to accuſe <hi>unjuſtly</hi> and <hi>falfely;</hi> for he ſaith, that I <hi>reproach</hi> Learning; which is <hi>abſolutely</hi> untrue; I doe onely but <hi>rank</hi> and <hi>place</hi> it where it <hi>ought</hi> to ſtand; neither doe I <hi>blaſphemouſly</hi> (like himſelfe) <hi>aſſume</hi> or <hi>attribute</hi> any divinity <hi>to my ſelf</hi> or <hi>words.</hi> Can any thing be truly and properly called <hi>DIVI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NITY</hi> but the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Being</hi> of God onely? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his <hi>Learning</hi> might have taught him more fit <hi>lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But he proceeds, and ſaith, That except the <hi>Old Serpent,</hi> and my ſelfe, (whom he, <hi>Serpent-like,</hi> calls his Diſciple) he never found any <hi>affirming</hi> that man <hi>wanted</hi> any thing in his innocency, <hi>pag.</hi> 111. Where did he finde (except in his own <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine-heart</hi>) that the <hi>Old Serpent</hi> did ever <hi>affirme</hi> that man <hi>wanted not</hi> any thing in his innocency? For if he had <hi>affirmed</hi> this, he had affirmed <hi>that truth</hi> which he <hi>hates.</hi> Did the man never finde, that the Spirit of God in the <hi>Scriptures</hi> doth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme that <hi>Man</hi> wanted the <hi>knowledge</hi> of evil; that he wanted <hi>ſin, corruption, miſery,</hi> and <hi>death,</hi> which all entred <hi>by the fall,</hi> and after it? Had man before the fall an <hi>ignorant, blind,</hi> and <hi>darkened</hi> ſoule, or a <hi>beſtiall</hi> nature, ſubject to <hi>diſeaſes,</hi> and <hi>death;</hi> or came not all theſe <hi>by,</hi> and <hi>after</hi> the fall? and ſo <hi>he
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:118719:158"/>wanted them</hi> before? Who is the Serpents <hi>diſciple,</hi> I, or the Armiger, let all <hi>knowing men</hi> judge? Thus the man <hi>argues againſt</hi> he neither knowes <hi>what,</hi> nor <hi>whom,</hi> with much <hi>railing,</hi> but no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
            <p>But now he ſaith he comes to the <hi>queſtion;</hi> That reaſon was <hi>depraved</hi> and <hi>darkened</hi> by the <hi>Fall;</hi> and that by the <hi>help of</hi> learning it is <hi>in ſome meaſure</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored; and this he allowes, and affirmes. Was this the queſtion <hi>propounded</hi> by me, let any man read, and judge? The great <hi>Logician</hi> with all his skill, commits that <hi>Fallacie</hi> which every <hi>minor</hi> So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſter would be <hi>aſhamed</hi> of, which is <hi>Petitio prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipii,</hi> the begging of the queſtion: For in the <hi>Quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> it is not <hi>ſuppoſed</hi> nor <hi>granted,</hi> that <hi>man</hi> before the fall had <hi>reaſon</hi> or <hi>humane learning,</hi> but is <hi>part of the queſtion</hi> it ſelfe: And he himſelf <hi>page</hi> 110, urges it as <hi>my</hi> affirmation, that man <hi>wanted</hi> it in his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, and yet now hath forgotten and loſt <hi>the ſtate of the queſtion.</hi> Therefore I muſt put him in mind of it againe, and tell him, that the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion was not whether <hi>reaſen</hi> were <hi>depraved</hi> by the fall, or in ſome meaſure <hi>reſtored</hi> by learning; but, whether <hi>before the fall</hi> he had <hi>reaſon</hi> or <hi>humane lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> or not; and ſo all that he <hi>ſpatters forth</hi> about falling into a <hi>pit,</hi> and <hi>getting out,</hi> and the reſt, to the middle of the 112. <hi>page,</hi> is but the <hi>foame</hi> of his <hi>raving</hi> fancy, and to no purpoſe in reſpect of my Quaery, but is altogether <hi>extra limites queſtionis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then he <hi>proceeds,</hi> and ſaith, <hi>The fellow ſeems to be a Scholler;</hi> I ſhall therefore ask him <hi>one</hi> queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. I would know of this <hi>Armiger</hi> how many
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:118719:158"/>ſuch <hi>fellows</hi> as my ſelf his <hi>Worſhip</hi> maintains to wait upon him? It may be he looks not upon me as <hi>his fellow;</hi> but however he might take me to be his brother <hi>Animal:</hi>

            <p>All the <hi>wiſdom</hi> of the <hi>fleſh</hi> is <hi>enmity</hi> againſt God.</p>
            <p>But <hi>all acquired learning</hi> is the wiſedome of the fleſh.</p>

            <p>And I muſt tell him, that I could have <hi>written</hi> and <hi>ſpoken</hi> as he doth, by the help <hi>onely</hi> of humane <hi>Learning;</hi> but I could not <hi>write</hi> nor <hi>ſpeak</hi> that <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery</hi> which hath been <hi>hidden from Ages and Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and is now made manifeſt unto his Saints,</hi>

            <p>And therefore leaving his <hi>Phyſicall</hi> Acts and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall</hi> Circumſtances, I ſhall from what hath been ſaid, ſhew him in what <hi>reſpects</hi> Theologically <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Learning</hi> is ſin.</p>

            <p>He goes on in the 127. and 128. pages, and asks whether all <hi>reading, hearing,</hi> and <hi>teaching,</hi> be like the <hi>principles</hi> from whence they <hi>flow?</hi> which he need not have <hi>reiterated;</hi> For I muſt let him know, that all theſe are <hi>either</hi> done in the <hi>power</hi> of that <hi>w ſedome</hi> which is <hi>from above,</hi> and then they are not ſinfull, or elſe in the power of that <hi>wiſedome</hi> that is from <hi>beneath,</hi> and then it is <hi>ſinfull</hi> and <hi>defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth.</hi> Therefore the Goſpel <hi>to ſuch</hi> is as a Parable, becauſe <hi>they ſeeing ſee not, and hearing they hear not,</hi>

            <p>Againe, he makes a <hi>great noiſe</hi> about <hi>outward</hi> means, and the <hi>inward</hi> aſſiſtance of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> but gives <hi>us no definitions</hi> what they are, nor what <hi>he means</hi> by them: I ſhall tell him in one word, There is no means <hi>under Heaven</hi> but Jeſus Chriſt <hi>only</hi> that either brings the <hi>Fathers love</hi> unto <hi>man,</hi> or <hi>man</hi> unto the <hi>Father:</hi> And therefore he might have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, that we are not <hi>arguing</hi> whether <hi>man</hi> may <hi>heare,</hi> or not <hi>heare; read,</hi> or not <hi>read;</hi> but,
